1
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,337
We now turn to the
hostile nation of North Korea.

2
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:46,638
The rocket they are testing
is believed to be big enough

3
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,542
to reach the West Coast
of the United States.

4
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:52,111
Today, an official
of the United Nations

5
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,647
tried to tell the world...
So there will be no mistake...

6
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:59,118
That we are living in the midst
of a modern-day Hitler.

7
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:02,588
A young, untested leader
with nuclear ambition.

8
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:04,356
- Kim Jong-un.
- Kim Jong-un.

9
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:06,725
We are talking
about Kim Jong-un.

10
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:08,260
Good evening.

11
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,162
I'm Dave Skylark.

12
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:13,766
Tonight, we are joined
by 13-time Grammy winner,

13
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:16,136
Oscar-winning songwriter,

14
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:18,570
Detroit's own Eminem.

15
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,140
He'll speak with us
about his new album,

16
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,842
which has been mired
in controversy

17
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:27,747
concerning lyrics that some view
as demeaning to the elderly.

18
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,549
Tonight...

19
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,283
on "Skylark Tonight."

20
00:02:39,824 --> 00:02:43,395
And... action.

21
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,764
"It's hell to be Shady.

22
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,332
"Yesterday I yelled
a degrading insult

23
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:49,334
"at an elderly lady.

24
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:52,771
"Then I asked her
how it felt to be 80.

25
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,842
"'F' word a senior citizen.

26
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,411
Suck a wiener, sit and spin."

27
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,346
"Suck a wiener, sit and spin."

28
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:01,580
It's funny.

29
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,617
"And why you drive
so slow for?

30
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,386
"Don't you want to get
where you're going faster

31
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:10,455
"since you'll probably die
tomorrow, you old whore?

32
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:12,425
"Die, old bitch, die,

33
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,260
before I murder you."

34
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,196
What do you mean by this, Em?

35
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:18,230
Well, first of all,
I feel like, when I rap,

36
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,667
like, people twist my words.

37
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,368
Okay, but can you see

38
00:03:23,468 --> 00:03:26,271
how an old person
might say, "I think

39
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,510
"what this guy is telling me...
this Eminem... is that I should

40
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,846
go kill myself, and I...
you know, I don't like that."

41
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:36,348
I mean, I don't

42
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,819
necessarily rap about
the things that I hate.

43
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,422
It's more about...
the things that I fear.

44
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,623
- I get you.
- You know, it's like,

45
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:47,693
- if I say something about women
or whatever... -Yes.

46
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,354
I think a lot of that
is more or less me

47
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,497
just dealing with issues with...

48
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:53,533
you know, old issues
with my mom or whatever.

49
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,933
With your "mutha."

50
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:57,302
Yeah, or-or... you know,

51
00:03:57,402 --> 00:03:58,722
when I say things
about gay people

52
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,405
or people think that
my lyrics are homophobic,

53
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,474
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, it's because I'm gay.

54
00:04:02,574 --> 00:04:04,643
Um, when I rap about violence

55
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:07,413
- Wait... -or, you know, sound
like I'm promoting violence,

56
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,716
I think that, uh... you know,

57
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,651
- it's more or less because...
- What? -What, what, what?

58
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,831
You know, it's kind of...
it's kind of about me just,

59
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:15,454
you know, confronting it.

60
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,923
- What did he just say?
- Wait, can we play that...?

61
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,658
- He said he was gay.
- Did he just...? Dave? Dave?

62
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:19,992
- Did he just say he was gay?
- We're pretty sure

63
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,995
in the booth we just heard him
say he was gay.

64
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,431
Em, let's just...
back it up a moment.

65
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:28,401
You... just said

66
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,469
that you were gay?

67
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:33,605
Um... and I'm just curious

68
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,708
what you meant
by that exactly.

69
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:37,677
I mean I'm gay.

70
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:40,812
Uh, I'm just a little
confused here, because "gay"

71
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,415
can mean a lot of things.

72
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:43,815
I am a homosexual.

73
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:48,820
Meaning...?

74
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,889
I like men.

75
00:04:52,824 --> 00:04:54,593
What the fuck just happened?

76
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,596
Eminem just said
he was gay... four times.

77
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,298
That's what the fuck
just happened.

78
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,432
- Holy shit.
- Holy shit.

79
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:00,699
Eminem's gay on our show.

80
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,701
- Eminem's gay on our show!
- Oh, my God!

81
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,304
Camera two! Camera two!

82
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:05,504
Gay Twitter!
Gay Twitter's blowing up.

83
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:06,885
- Holy shit.
- Change the chyron.

84
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,441
"Eminem Gay?!"
Question mark, exclamation mark.

85
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,043
Dave, keep him talking.
Keep him talking.

86
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,879
- Oh, my God. -Holy shit.
Push in on gay Eminem!

87
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,658
This is the greatest moment
in gay history!

88
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:17,916
...are probably shocked by what
you're saying right now.

89
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:20,853
I'm more shocked that people
haven't figured it out yet.

90
00:05:20,952 --> 00:05:23,455
I mean, it's kind of like
I've been playing gay peekaboo.

91
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:24,890
Gay peekaboo.

92
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,325
Yeah. But, um...

93
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:27,659
Shit.
Camera one. Camera one.

94
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,399
- This interview is over.
Shut it off. -No!

95
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:30,896
- Shut it off. -Get the fuck
out of here, Darryl.

96
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,632
I am Marshall's publicist,
and I'm telling you,

97
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,033
- pull the fucking plug
right now. -No. This is gold.

98
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:35,634
I am not cutting
this interview off.

99
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,002
This is the best interview
we've ever done.

100
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,638
- What happens if I just do this?
- No, get out.

101
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:41,540
Shut it off! Shut it off!

102
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,475
Get him out of here!
Get him the fuck out of here!

103
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:44,877
I will murder you
and everyone you love!

104
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:47,045
Thank you.
Dave, look, I got the lyrics.

105
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,514
Say what I say:

106
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:51,550
What did you mean
when you rapped...

107
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,752
"I said nice rectum, I had a..."

108
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,487
"...vasectomy, Hector.

109
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,757
"So you can't get pregnant

110
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,893
if I bisexually wreck ya."

111
00:06:00,992 --> 00:06:02,961
I've pretty much
just been leaving a...

112
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,831
bread-crumb trail of gayness.

113
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,665
- I see that now.
- You know.

114
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,900
But yeah, actually Hector...

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,769
Hector was a...
was a real person.

116
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,038
Hector and his rectum were real?

117
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:14,439
- Holy shit. -It's real!
Hector rectum is real!

118
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,777
- Yes! Yes! -Oh, I knew it!
- Slim Shady, everyone!

119
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,644
Dude! Dude!

120
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:20,380
Aaron, bring it in.

121
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,448
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Bring it in, big boy!

122
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,828
Oh, my God...

123
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:25,851
- Oh...!
- Oh, my God!

124
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:27,420
What the heck just happened?

125
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,854
The real Slim Shady
just stood up.

126
00:06:28,954 --> 00:06:30,522
Oh! -That's what the fuck
just happened.

127
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:32,791
This is like Spike Lee
just said he's white.

128
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:34,171
I can't believe what's happened.

129
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:36,128
- You da man! You da man!
- You da man!

130
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:37,396
You're the best.

131
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,997
You're the best.
You're the best.

132
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,633
- Unreal. -All right, listen,
I'm gonna go get my makeup off.

133
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,834
I want you to meet me
downstairs.

134
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,102
I got something to show you.

135
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:45,404
Dude, just...
where are we going?

136
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:47,406
I thought we were going to the
Hamptons for the weekend, man.

137
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,875
- No, no, no, no, no, no...
- What is this place?

138
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,811
We're just, you know...
just hanging out.

139
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,079
- Okay. -All right,
all right, all right.

140
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,947
It's a surprise party... for you.

141
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,850
What? Why? Why did you
just tell me that?

142
00:06:57,949 --> 00:06:59,418
Yes! I...
'Cause I'm so excited.

143
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,420
This is gonna be great.
This is gonna be great.

144
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,687
I don't understand
what's happening.

145
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:04,723
Surprise!

146
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,158
All right, all right.
I already told him.

147
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,860
I already told him.
Come on, come on.

148
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,561
You're best in the world,
you fucking cocksucker.

149
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:11,430
All right, not now, Malcolm.
Not now, not now. Come on.

150
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,531
- Come on. -Thank you.
Why... why is this happening?

151
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,100
You've been with us

152
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,636
for 1,000 episodes.

153
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,771
- Are you kidding me?
- Ten years, baby!

154
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,138
- Are you fucking...
- Come on.

155
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:22,174
I really do. It's, uh...
I appreciate it.

156
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:23,842
- All right.
- Okay.

157
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:25,444
All right, now,

158
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:29,615
I know I like
to keep it light, keep it fun.

159
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:32,617
I'm gonna take it
to a serious tip.

160
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,987
I'm gonna talk about Aaron.

161
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:37,456
Before we started
working together,

162
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,926
my show barely broke the top 15.

163
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,927
So I called up
this professor that worked

164
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,828
at the Columbia School
of Journalism that I...

165
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:45,598
I was having sex with,
and I said,

166
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:49,067
"I need someone smarter
than anyone in entertainment.

167
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,137
I need a real journalist."

168
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,907
Aaron, you are
the Samwise Gamgee

169
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,043
to my Frodo Baggins.

170
00:07:57,142 --> 00:08:00,612
You are the Gandalf
to my Bilbo Baggins.

171
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:03,783
But of all the Lord of the Rings
references that I could make,

172
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:05,150
this is the most important:

173
00:08:06,884 --> 00:08:09,622
I'm Gollum...

174
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:12,224
...and you're my precious.

175
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:15,894
Smeagol needs Aaron.

176
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,896
"One Ring to rule them all,

177
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,500
and in the darkness
bind them."

178
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,236
Now, get up here!
Get up here!

179
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,705
- Come up here, buddy.
I love you. -Okay. Okay. Okay.

180
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,673
- I fucking love you.
- Oh...

181
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,778
Hey.

182
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:36,048
Hey!

183
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,050
Hey.

184
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:40,819
Yeah. Like, what's that?

185
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,920
Come on, man.
What's happening?

186
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,655
- Hey, yeah.
- Hey, yeah.

187
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:45,190
- Wh-What's happening?
- How's it going, dude?

188
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,927
We haven't seen each other
since graduation, right?

189
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,129
- Yeah. Probably.
- Wow. And, uh...

190
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,198
Wait. Am I wrong?
Are you, like, a...

191
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,533
you're a junior producer
on "60 Minutes," right?

192
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,768
I'm now a senior producer.

193
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,169
- No way, man.
- Yeah. Yeah.

194
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:58,703
- That's awesome.
- Thank you.

195
00:08:58,803 --> 00:09:01,841
Look at us... both producing news
for television.

196
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,009
Yeah.

197
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,677
- What was that?
- Nothing.

198
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,846
It was clearly something.
What's the joke?

199
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,548
No, I mean, like,
you've got your job,

200
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,116
I got mine, but they're
different, you know?

201
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:12,585
Yours is cool; mine's just

202
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:13,952
a little bit more serious,
you know?

203
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:16,121
What are you saying?
We have the same job.

204
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:19,257
I report real news...
you know, stuff that matters...

205
00:09:19,357 --> 00:09:21,626
and then you report
on all the cool

206
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:22,727
"who's getting new boobs"
and, like,

207
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:24,262
the fun eating disorder stuff.

208
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,132
You really helped build up
"60 Minutes," too, right?

209
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:27,766
They'd be nothing without you.

210
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:29,267
It's only been on
for 80 fucking years.

211
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:30,836
Look, I... I'm sorry.

212
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:32,238
I'm sorry... look...
I shouldn't say this,

213
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:34,173
but we got an opening
over at "60 Minutes,"

214
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,142
and we could use
somebody like you.

215
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:37,776
Are you serious?

216
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:39,578
I'm fucking with you, man.
Come on! You?

217
00:09:39,678 --> 00:09:41,780
At where I work? You'd be
eaten alive at our office.

218
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,716
Okay, I'm gonna catch up
with these guys,

219
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:44,917
but cheers, man.

220
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,153
Congrats... or whatever.

221
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:53,725
When did the hair begin to go?

222
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,226
I would say...

223
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:56,928
around "The Outsiders."

224
00:10:00,264 --> 00:10:02,099
When you're ready.

225
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,004
I don't think I'll ever
be ready, but...

226
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,139
- Oh, wig's coming off.
- Oh.

227
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:14,080
Whoa.

228
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:15,747
Oh, Jesus fuck.

229
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:17,750
Why does he keep
the long pieces?

230
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,619
His head looks like
somebody's taint.

231
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,887
- You barely look different.
- Thanks, man.

232
00:10:21,986 --> 00:10:23,622
You... you said you were bald.

233
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:25,290
I... I see a little stuff
on top.

234
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,158
- It's so freeing!
- Rob...

235
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:32,031
is there anything that you would
like to say to America?

236
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:37,936
Good evening.

237
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,037
I'm Phillip Sterling

238
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,940
with a UBS News Special Report.

239
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,173
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

240
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,875
Kim Jong-un's military forces

241
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:46,312
targeted an uninhabited
South Pacific island

242
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,315
with a 15-megaton
thermonuclear ICBM.

243
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:50,949
Yo, Dave, we're not
live anymore.

244
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:52,851
- They just cut our feed.
- We're off the air?

245
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:55,888
Goddamn it! Rob, would you just
put your fucking wig on?

246
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,657
They fucked us! Goddamn it!

247
00:10:57,756 --> 00:10:59,190
Somebody tell me
what's going on?

248
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:03,729
Dude... seriously,
what is up with you?

249
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:06,064
You know how I'm good
at picking up energies?

250
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:08,800
Well, you're shooting off a
slightly cunty vibe right now.

251
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,368
What's going on?

252
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,004
We have millions
of viewers every night

253
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,739
watching our show,
and what do we do?

254
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,274
We just shovel shit
into their faces, man.

255
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,076
We could be doing
something positive.

256
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,980
We could be having on authors,
activists, politicians.

257
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,982
That's what people want.
"Give us some shit.

258
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:24,817
"Mangia. We're the people.
Give us the shit.

259
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,686
Mangia, mangia, mangia."

260
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:30,221
Dude, I wanted to cover actual
news, not Nicki Minaj's vagina

261
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,722
fuckin' flopping out
at the Grammys.

262
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,031
You don't like
that brown sugar?

263
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:34,693
Nothing to do
with brown sugar.

264
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:36,153
I just can't keep
doing this, okay?

265
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:37,328
We have to change.

266
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:42,967
- Fine.
- Are you serious right now?

267
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:44,937
- Yeah.
- Do you promise you'll do this?

268
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,107
I promise if you promise
you'll never leave.

269
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:49,774
If you promise,
then I'll promise.

270
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,309
- Well, then, same time.
- One, two, three.

271
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:52,410
- Promise.
- Promise.

272
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,510
- Okay.
- Okay.

273
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,947
That's all we had to say.

274
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,449
- Fine.
- Don't put me through that.

275
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:59,150
- Okay.
- I hate it when we fight.

276
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,386
No, this is not a joke, okay?

277
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:03,154
Well, I think you're being
kind of condescending.

278
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:04,423
- Look! Look, look, look...
- What? Yeah... one second.

279
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,158
Shut up. I'm on the phone.

280
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,893
Okay? Uh...

281
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,996
Dude, what the fuck, man?
That was John Kerry's office.

282
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:12,264
Forget that
oak-tree-looking fuck.

283
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,399
This tops it.
"The Times" printed it

284
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,869
about... about North Korea.
Read the bottom.

285
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,472
After all the...
the death camp shit.

286
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,373
"Although Kim Jong-un
rallies his people

287
00:12:21,472 --> 00:12:23,274
"with cries for the destruction

288
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,443
"of the United States
of America, he is known

289
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:28,213
"to be an avid consumer
of American entertainment.

290
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:31,149
His favorite shows
are 'The Big Bang Theory...'"

291
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,085
And...?

292
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:35,453
"...and 'Skylark Tonight.'"

293
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:37,222
Oh! Boom!

294
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,392
This is great!

295
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:42,227
This is what you
were talking about.

296
00:12:42,327 --> 00:12:44,329
I interview this guy.

297
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:45,997
Are you joking me, man?
He's the most

298
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:47,198
reclusive leader on the planet.

299
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:48,800
It's not gonna happen.

300
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,769
He lives in North Korea.
We can't go there.

301
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,905
Dave Skylark...
gets in anywhere.

302
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:55,807
You remember that club?

303
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,176
Three-month waiting list.

304
00:12:57,275 --> 00:12:58,843
First night.

305
00:12:58,943 --> 00:13:01,045
I don't think it's
quite the same thing.

306
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:03,181
Well, there were a lot
of Asian girls there.

307
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,450
It's impossible, Dave.

308
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:05,817
Here's what we're gonna do.

309
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,418
We're gonna do that interview,

310
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,023
everyone is gonna take you
super-duper seriously,

311
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,526
and then you're never
gonna leave me.

312
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,461
North Korea's
in the Olympics, right?

313
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,495
I bet they have
an office that is

314
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,197
set up to communicate
with the Olympic Committee,

315
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,432
so there's probably

316
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:22,368
some infrastructure
for communicating with

317
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,068
the outside world
through that.

318
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:25,804
Good idea.
Those wheels are turning.

319
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:27,472
- If I leave a message
for that office... -Yeah.

320
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:29,341
- then maybe, if they're
a fan of the show, -Mm-hmm.

321
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,143
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- That can actually work.

322
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,212
- We could interview the most
famous man on the planet. -Yeah.

323
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,947
- That would be the biggest
interview ever. -Yeah...

324
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,481
Guys, guys, guys, guys!
I don't know if you've

325
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:38,261
heard this, but some
pictures just came out

326
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,884
where it looks like
McConaughey's fucking a goat.

327
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,221
- Whoa. "McConaughey Goat Fuck"?
- Ew...

328
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,956
McConaughey Goat Fuck.

329
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,391
Uh...

330
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,026
Okay, we obviously have
to have him on to do that,

331
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:49,460
so... we should
put that together.

332
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:51,363
But we're doing this
North Korea thing, okay?

333
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:53,264
- First thing tomorrow. Okay.
- Book him, though. Book him.

334
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,000
- Get him, get him, get him!
Get the goat! -I'm on him.

335
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,836
Get the goat!

336
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,838
I got some questions
for that goat.

337
00:14:04,943 --> 00:14:07,378
Hello. This is Aaron Rapoport
from "Skylark Tonight."

338
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,281
We heard your Supreme Leader
is a big fan

339
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,382
of our show, and we'd love
to have him on.

340
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:14,018
Uh, please get back to me
and let me know.

341
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,154
I'm about to head
to an important meeting,

342
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:17,990
but, uh, I'll be around
in the morning.

343
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,370
Hope to hear from you.

344
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:22,060
Ooh! Yeah.

345
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,562
- Hi.
- Hey.

346
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,566
Uh, Mercer and Spring, please.

347
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,568
Whoo!

348
00:14:36,674 --> 00:14:38,043
Hello?

349
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,445
Hello. Who dis?

350
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:41,279
I am trying
to reach Aaron Rapoport.

351
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:42,615
You got Aaron Rapoport.

352
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,884
- Who dis is?
- You left word

353
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,118
with our office
regarding an interview.

354
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:47,586
Look, Dave, is this you?

355
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,054
'Cause if it is,

356
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:51,423
you're doing
a terrible Asian accent.

357
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,957
Me so "solly."

358
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:55,126
Me gots to go now, son.

359
00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:57,096
I am from the office
of Sook-yin Park,

360
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,898
Secretary of Communications

361
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,078
with the Democratic People's
Republic of North Korea.

362
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,035
Oh, my God. Uh...

363
00:15:03,134 --> 00:15:04,636
Shit. Uh, me so solly.

364
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:06,905
I mean, I'm so solly.
I mean, I-I'm so sor...

365
00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:09,975
I'm-I'm... I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

366
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,645
We would like to discuss
the possibility of a meeting

367
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,047
between the Supreme Leader
and Dave Skylark.

368
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,248
Security concerns dictate

369
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:18,449
that the matter
be discussed in person.

370
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:21,085
Uh, okay, great.
Where... where do you do that?

371
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:24,490
We will meet
at latitude 40.1326,

372
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,393
longitude 123.9889.

373
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,228
Just 'cause I'm not, like,
totally familiar

374
00:15:29,327 --> 00:15:30,495
with my longitudes
and latitudes,

375
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,197
where is that again?

376
00:15:32,297 --> 00:15:35,634
50 kilometers west of Dandong,
northeastern China.

377
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,469
Did you just say "China"?

378
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:39,471
And did you just say "dong"?

379
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,314
Going to motherfucking
China, y'all.

380
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,365
Excuse me,
can I get in there?

381
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,134
Thank you.

382
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,602
Hi, there.

383
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,206
No, thank you.

384
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,442
I'll just get it
through secondhand smoke.

385
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:21,412
Selfie!

386
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:51,442
Well, where the fuck are they?

387
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,379
What the fuck?

388
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:10,428
No, no!

389
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,115
No! No!

390
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:31,750
I'm an American journalist!

391
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:32,849
Aaron Rapoport!

392
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:33,917
I was invited here!

393
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,555
I come in peace!

394
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:37,689
I'm here for interview!

395
00:17:37,788 --> 00:17:41,359
Please don't kill me!

396
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:56,508
Mr. Rapoport,
I am Sook-yin Park.

397
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:59,077
The Supreme Leader will grant
a one-hour interview

398
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,380
to Mr. Skylark
from inside North Korea.

399
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,316
All questions will be supplied
by the Supreme Leader himself.

400
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,653
Terms are nonnegotiable.
You have 24 hours to decide.

401
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:10,655
- That's it?
- Yes.

402
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,724
Why didn't you guys tell me this
over the phone?

403
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:14,660
Or Skype?
Do you guys have Skype?

404
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,528
Do you have Skype here?
Okay.

405
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:18,429
Well, look, can you give me
some water?

406
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:20,398
That guy has water!

407
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,500
Please give me a ride somewhere!

408
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,536
I didn't pack well
for this trip!

409
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:26,404
I packed like a fool!

410
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,740
Like a goddamn fool!

411
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:31,809
Please! Please!

412
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,146
Whoa.

413
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,428
Damn, she was sexy.

414
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,829
The fucking helicopter landed.

415
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,465
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

416
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,134
Two soldiers jump out.

417
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:56,393
I think I'm gonna get killed.

418
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,737
Then, out comes Sook.

419
00:18:58,836 --> 00:18:59,836
I told you about her.

420
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:01,373
She comes out of the helicopter.

421
00:19:01,472 --> 00:19:03,241
- She's hot, super sexy.
- How hot?

422
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,910
- Did you get in there? -Yeah,
I fucked her in the helicopter.

423
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:06,310
My fucking man!

424
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,881
No, I didn't do that, dude.
No!

425
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,781
- Okay. -She said we couldn't ask
any of our own questions.

426
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:13,185
They were gonna write
all the questions.

427
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,319
We can't do it.

428
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:15,586
We're essentially letting him

429
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:18,156
interview himself
with your mouth.

430
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,458
Look!

431
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:20,625
Look at this buttfuck!

432
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,861
He's got a whole parade
of nukes.

433
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,229
He's ready to use them.

434
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:26,397
When you score a bin Laden

435
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,401
or a Hitler or an Un,

436
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,869
you take it by the balls!

437
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,605
It's the first rule
of journalism.

438
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:35,606
You give the people
what they want.

439
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:36,909
That's not the first rule
of journalism.

440
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,289
I think that's
the first rule of,

441
00:19:38,376 --> 00:19:39,856
like, circuses
and demolition derbies.

442
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:42,880
This is the biggest interview
since Frosty Nixon.

443
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,883
- Frosty Nixon?
- I mean, in ten years,

444
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:47,251
Ron Howard's gonna make
a movie out of this.

445
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,487
We do this, we can interview

446
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:51,390
any president on the planet.

447
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,192
And then you can ask them
the real questions.

448
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:57,361
This is like
eating our vegetables.

449
00:19:57,461 --> 00:19:58,596
Once you eat those,

450
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:00,398
then you get to eat the steak.

451
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,500
And we know Aaron
wants his steak.

452
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,370
This is like...

453
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,505
"The Lord of the Rings."

454
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,272
Okay?

455
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,710
I'm actually like Frodo Baggins.

456
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:16,682
And you are my Sam.

457
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:17,949
My Samwise.

458
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:19,917
I can't do it without you.

459
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,653
- Okay.
- Come with me.

460
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:23,288
To Mordor.

461
00:20:23,387 --> 00:20:24,956
Okay, let's fucking do it.

462
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,692
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

463
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,830
As always,
I'd like to thank my guest,

464
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,466
Joe Gordon-Levitt.

465
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,733
And before we go,

466
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,570
I have
a very special announcement.

467
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,807
With the help
of my outstanding producer,

468
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:44,809
Aaron Rapoport, I've secured
the most important interview

469
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,246
of the 21st century.

470
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,280
Three weeks from tonight,

471
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,351
I will be traveling
to Pyongyang, North Korea,

472
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:56,355
to conduct the first
globally broadcast interview

473
00:20:56,454 --> 00:20:58,423
with President Kim Jong-un.

474
00:20:58,522 --> 00:21:01,859
I am deeply humbled
and profoundly honored

475
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,430
to accept this
most awesome responsibility.

476
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:07,865
Apparently, Dave Skylark
will be interviewing

477
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:09,834
the dictator of North Korea.

478
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:11,903
100 bucks Skylark thinks

479
00:21:12,002 --> 00:21:13,838
he's the guy
from "Gangnam Style."

480
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,608
Obscene glorification
of a brutal dictator.

481
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,442
This is a man who tortures,

482
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:20,678
terrorizes and starves
his own people.

483
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:23,448
- Skylark is beneath despicable.
- Fuck this.

484
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,517
Meeee-ow.

485
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:28,052
What a fucking bitch,
am I right?

486
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,721
No, you're not right.

487
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,722
He's not being a bitch.
He's completely right.

488
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:35,527
He's motherfucking
peanut butter and jealous.

489
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:37,028
- He's not jealous.
- He's putting

490
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:39,030
KY jealous all over his dick.

491
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,033
What is there to be jealous of?

492
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,067
Fuckers hate us
'cause they ain't us.

493
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:44,735
They hates us 'cause we "anus"?

494
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,716
What the fuck does an anus
have to do with this?

495
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,074
They hate us
'cause they ain't us.

496
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:50,808
That's not what it is.

497
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,344
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

498
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:53,711
They hate us 'cause we is us,

499
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:55,813
and what we is doing
is fucking terrible.

500
00:21:55,913 --> 00:21:57,715
They fucking hate us
'cause they ain't us.

501
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,750
- Stop saying that. They don't
- Hate us 'cause they ain't us.

502
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,820
- Hate us 'cause they ain't us!
- Hate us 'cause they ain't us!

503
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,689
- They don't hate us 'cause they
ain't us. -I'm used to it.

504
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:05,788
- Hate us 'cause they ain't us.
- Stop it. Stop it.

505
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,060
- Don't say it again.
- Shh.

506
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,661
Baby.

507
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,629
Haters gonna hate.

508
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,566
And ain't-ers gonna ain't.

509
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:17,068
That is not an actual thing
people say.

510
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,937
This is what you do to haters.

511
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,840
You just smile.

512
00:22:28,012 --> 00:22:29,947
What is that?

513
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,951
The strongest ecstasy
I've ever done in my life.

514
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:55,005
Oh...

515
00:22:55,105 --> 00:22:57,075
Oh, what the fuck?

516
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,379
Okay.

517
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:02,748
Okay, I'm coming.

518
00:23:08,452 --> 00:23:09,954
Oh, shit.

519
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:13,557
Oh... oh, God.

520
00:23:16,093 --> 00:23:17,429
Mr. Rapoport.

521
00:23:17,528 --> 00:23:18,896
I'm Agent Lacey

522
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,132
with Central Intelligence,

523
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:21,700
and this is my partner,
Agent Botwin.

524
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,601
Aaron, whoever that is,

525
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:24,869
tell them to fuck off.

526
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,704
Dave, it's, uh,

527
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,841
- it's not... -Yo, I don't know
who I fucked last night,

528
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,177
but I got some stink dick.

529
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:35,180
Yo, my dick stinks!

530
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,782
So weird how you, like,

531
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,050
just want to keep
smelling it, though.

532
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:42,487
Yo, you got to come over
and smell this shit.

533
00:23:42,586 --> 00:23:43,721
Yo, come smell this.

534
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:44,855
You got to identify this.

535
00:23:44,955 --> 00:23:46,057
I don't know what it is.

536
00:23:46,156 --> 00:23:47,826
Excuse him.

537
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:49,160
He has stink dick.

538
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,430
It kind of smells
like guacamole.

539
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:53,131
May we come in?

540
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,433
Would you, um,

541
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,603
like a drink or some
of Aaron's cocaine?

542
00:23:58,702 --> 00:24:00,638
This is not our cocaine.
This is...

543
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,073
No, I'm sure it's not.

544
00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:05,509
So, uh, how can we, uh,
what can we do you for?

545
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:07,144
- Yeah, to what do we owe
the pleasure? -AARON: Yeah.

546
00:24:07,244 --> 00:24:08,679
Well, Aaron, Dave,

547
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:09,847
as I'm sure

548
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,615
you know already,

549
00:24:11,715 --> 00:24:12,883
Kim Jong-un is now capable

550
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:16,187
of nuking all of
the West Coast.

551
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,789
The point is we're talking
about nuclear nations

552
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,792
at war with each other.

553
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,160
Nuclear.

554
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:23,561
He does have one

555
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,896
tactical advantage
over the West.

556
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,900
He's more than willing
to let millions and millions

557
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,469
of his own people die.

558
00:24:30,568 --> 00:24:33,704
Ba-bam. Explosions.
All over my face.

559
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,907
I'm sorry, we had kind
of a long night last night.

560
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,075
Why are you telling us

561
00:24:37,174 --> 00:24:38,976
- all this information?
- Well,

562
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:41,980
well, we're telling you this
because you two lucky gentlemen

563
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:43,914
are going to be in a room alone
with him,

564
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,484
and congratulations, by the way.

565
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:46,918
That's right!

566
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,698
Which is part of the reason
why we're here.

567
00:24:48,752 --> 00:24:50,187
The CIA would love it

568
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:52,557
if you two could...

569
00:24:52,656 --> 00:24:54,558
take him out.

570
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,796
Hmm?

571
00:24:57,895 --> 00:24:59,530
- Take him out.
- Take him out?

572
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,199
- Like, for drinks?
- No, no, no.

573
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:03,067
- Take him out.
- Take out.

574
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:04,902
- Like, to dinner?
- Take him out to a meal?

575
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:06,203
Take him out.

576
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,906
- Like, on the town?
- Party?

577
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,908
No, uh...

578
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,076
take him out.

579
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:15,746
You want us to assassinate
the leader of North Korea?

580
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:18,682
- Yes.
- What...?!

581
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:20,142
If we kill him,
won't they just get

582
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:21,738
another chubby dude
with a goofy hairdo

583
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,121
to come in and replace him?

584
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,757
- Exactly, exactly. -And then
the same thing happens?

585
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:27,625
Uh, actually,
we're aware of a small faction

586
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,095
in the existing leadership
that already wants him gone.

587
00:25:30,194 --> 00:25:32,596
They want change; they're
too scared to act alone,

588
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:33,998
and they need you two
to go in there...

589
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:35,266
Hmm...

590
00:25:35,366 --> 00:25:39,136
remove Kim,
embolden them to revolt

591
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,105
and take over.

592
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:44,542
Are you, Agent Lacey,
going to be involved?

593
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,645
I am going to be in your ear,

594
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:51,115
by your side,
every step of the way.

595
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:53,984
Then I have one answer.

596
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,921
No more Kim.

597
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,755
Uh, you know what?

598
00:25:57,855 --> 00:25:59,057
Actually, I think we should
talk about it more.

599
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:00,791
- Okay, all right.
- Okay, let's just...

600
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,860
- We're just gonna talk.
- We're just gonna talk.

601
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
By all means.

602
00:26:02,993 --> 00:26:03,993
Just for the record,

603
00:26:03,994 --> 00:26:05,996
I don't have stink dick.

604
00:26:06,096 --> 00:26:08,333
Come over here, come here,
come in here...

605
00:26:08,432 --> 00:26:11,135
I think we need to do this.

606
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,672
She is so cool.

607
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:15,811
You don't see what's happening,
and it's so obvious.

608
00:26:15,906 --> 00:26:16,907
- It's crazy, man.
- What?

609
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,677
They're honeypotting us.

610
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:19,857
- What?
- It's an attractive

611
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,278
spy woman who lures men

612
00:26:21,378 --> 00:26:22,780
into doing shit they're
not supposed to do.

613
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,015
How can you not see that?

614
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,750
- Because that is so sexist.
- Is it?

615
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:27,851
- This is 2014.
- Dude...

616
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:29,220
Women are smart now.

617
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:31,088
Do you actually think
she just so happens

618
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,990
to have everything
you find attractive?

619
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,826
Bangs, giant tits, glasses?

620
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:36,926
They're fake, man.

621
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:38,295
Fake glasses?

622
00:26:38,395 --> 00:26:40,164
How could the CIA come up
with such a thing?

623
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,932
Well, that poor girl
is blind as a bat.

624
00:26:42,032 --> 00:26:44,802
Okay, I'm just saying that
when we're on Molly

625
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,337
and when we're horned up
might not be...

626
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,339
- Horned up?
- You are horned up.

627
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,840
Oh, please!

628
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,043
You got half a fucking
chub right now!

629
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,812
- Take your hands away.
- Hmm-mm.

630
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,313
- I saw the boner.
- I'm not taking my hands away.

631
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,981
Move your fucking hands.

632
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:58,216
Fine, you want to see it?

633
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,018
- Yeah.
- Feast your eyes.

634
00:27:00,117 --> 00:27:01,086
Okay, here's what's
gonna happen.

635
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:02,425
I'm gonna poop out these drugs.

636
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:03,688
You're gonna go jerk off
these thoughts.

637
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,323
If we both still want to talk

638
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,959
about this afterwards, then
we can, but not until then.

639
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:11,028
Dave Skylark never backs down
from a jerk-off.

640
00:27:13,396 --> 00:27:15,700
In three days,

641
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:17,868
you will fly from New York
to Beijing,

642
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,238
where you will transfer
to a commercial airline

643
00:27:20,337 --> 00:27:22,641
that takes you directly
to Pyongyang.

644
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,142
I'm sorry,
this is completely unrelated,

645
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:27,645
but, um, what happened
to your glasses?

646
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,816
Oh, I... I got LASIK.

647
00:27:31,915 --> 00:27:33,350
Between the time
I saw you and now?

648
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,854
- Yes.
- Okay.

649
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:37,989
Now, our intelligence suggests
that you will be taken here,

650
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:40,958
to Kim Jong-un's
personal compound.

651
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:43,293
So, preceding the interview,

652
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:45,363
you are going
to shake Kim's hand,

653
00:27:45,462 --> 00:27:48,832
administering
a fatal dose of poison

654
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:51,403
with this, a transdermal
time-delayed

655
00:27:51,502 --> 00:27:52,903
ricin strip.

656
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:54,371
When you shake his hand,

657
00:27:54,471 --> 00:27:57,741
the poison will be absorbed
into his skin,

658
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,745
where it metabolizes
for a 12-hour period.

659
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,748
Nobody will have any idea
you two were involved.

660
00:28:03,847 --> 00:28:05,383
No one will know?

661
00:28:05,482 --> 00:28:09,788
The United States must maintain
total and complete deniability.

662
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:12,122
- Total deniability?
- Obviously.

663
00:28:12,222 --> 00:28:13,857
- This isn't what I pictured.
- What did you picture?

664
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,759
I walk in there
like a fucking gangster

665
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:17,928
and blow
his little fucking ass away

666
00:28:18,028 --> 00:28:19,263
on television.

667
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,400
This is a major
television event.

668
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,103
You don't want to blow it
with offscreen death.

669
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:27,004
Okay?

670
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:30,741
Look, in porno, we call
this the money shot.

671
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,711
You don't have a bunch of dudes
going at it,

672
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,413
and then right before
they finish, you cut to black

673
00:28:35,512 --> 00:28:36,947
and say, "Oh, don't worry,

674
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,017
12 hours later,
they came all over each other."

675
00:28:39,116 --> 00:28:40,918
No! We want

676
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,287
the all-over close-up.

677
00:28:42,386 --> 00:28:43,153
All over his face.

678
00:28:43,253 --> 00:28:45,490
The end!

679
00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:47,357
Ah...

680
00:28:48,358 --> 00:28:49,827
Bam!

681
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,062
What kind of porn
are you watching?

682
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,522
What happens when
all of his guards

683
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:54,732
start firing back at you
for killing their leader

684
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,167
right in front of them?

685
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,036
- That's a good question.
- My bulletproof vest...

686
00:28:58,135 --> 00:29:00,238
No, you don't have
a bulletproof vest.

687
00:29:00,337 --> 00:29:02,840
- You don't have one of those.
- I will dodge those bullets.

688
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,976
What happens after you escape
the compound, Dave?

689
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,344
I look back over my shoulder.

690
00:29:06,443 --> 00:29:08,245
I see Aaron.
I grab him by the hand.

691
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,847
We run out into the woods.

692
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,817
Perhaps there's
a secret tunnel there.

693
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:14,318
We exit said tunnel.

694
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,455
At a designated spot,
SEAL Team Six

695
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,923
swoops in, puts us on one

696
00:29:20,023 --> 00:29:22,793
of those inflatable motorboats,
we hit the water,

697
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:25,163
we're out of there,
on our way to you.

698
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:27,765
If you did try to do this,
what would kill you first?

699
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:28,905
Sub-freezing temperatures.

700
00:29:28,932 --> 00:29:30,201
I don't like the cold.

701
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,003
- Okay, we...
- Starvation, starve to death.

702
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,806
You telling me the CIA
doesn't have

703
00:29:34,905 --> 00:29:36,941
North Face jackets
and some Pirate Booty?

704
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,475
Cap'n Crunch?

705
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:39,943
What about Siberian tigers?

706
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,980
- Did you think about that?
- What?

707
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:43,380
You're not going to shoot him.

708
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,848
There's not going to be
a bulletproof vest,

709
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,351
and nobody
is going to know

710
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,252
that you had anything
to do with this.

711
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,121
That's it, that's the plan.

712
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:51,288
- Period.
- Okay.

713
00:29:51,388 --> 00:29:52,890
Two years later,

714
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,992
I come out
with my bestselling tell-all.

715
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,361
"An Unexpected Journey:

716
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,497
Dave Skylark's Adventures
in North Korea."

717
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:01,132
You can't write a tell-all.

718
00:30:01,231 --> 00:30:02,901
"We were an oddly-shaped
gray room

719
00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:04,868
"at the CIA headquarters.

720
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,004
The titillating Agent Lacey..."

721
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:07,238
Stop doing that.

722
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:08,972
- Why?
- There's no tell-all.

723
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,242
"'There's no tell-all, '
Agent Lacey said.

724
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,044
"She looked at him.

725
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,447
She trembled with rage,
or was it passion?"

726
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:18,850
- Stop it.
- I just want everybody to know

727
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,152
that I know
what you did to me

728
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:23,221
- With the glasses?
- What?

729
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,423
- Honeycombed me.
- What does that even mean?

730
00:30:25,522 --> 00:30:27,192
You honeypotted him.
It's honeypot.

731
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:29,011
- You honeypotted me.
- You honeypotted him.

732
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,893
- No, I didn't. -He's said
a lot of stupid shit

733
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,063
in the last ten minutes,
but for reals,

734
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,530
you did honeypot him.

735
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:35,567
I bet you got him in here
as a honey dick

736
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,301
just in case I'm gay,
but I'm not,

737
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,136
but if I was, I would've
seen him coming a mile away.

738
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,538
- You honey dicking? -Look, she's
not honeypotting you,

739
00:30:41,638 --> 00:30:43,540
- and I'm not honey dicking him.
- It's very offensive,

740
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,543
'cause basically if you think
about what you're saying to me,

741
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,010
you're saying
because I'm a girl,

742
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,880
and because I'm attractive,

743
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,016
my only use for this agency
would be to manipulate men.

744
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:53,417
I think it's offensive, too.

745
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,078
and that's exactly
what I said to Aaron.

746
00:30:55,118 --> 00:30:56,920
I said that bitch
is blind as a bat.

747
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,423
Can we please move on?

748
00:30:58,522 --> 00:31:01,091
We have a dictator to kill.

749
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,228
When handling the ricin strip,

750
00:31:03,327 --> 00:31:05,596
operate with extreme caution.

751
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:08,498
Even momentary flesh contact
with the exposed strip is fatal.

752
00:31:08,598 --> 00:31:11,568
The poison will lay dormant
for 12 hours.

753
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,638
After it passes
the blood-brain barrier,

754
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,374
your heart rate
would shoot up to 160.

755
00:31:16,473 --> 00:31:18,342
Your body will strain
to reject the poison

756
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:20,577
by profusely sweating,
defecating, vomiting.

757
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:21,958
Within minutes,
you will be dead.

758
00:31:22,012 --> 00:31:23,380
- Okay.
- Got it?

759
00:31:25,715 --> 00:31:28,452
Aaron peels
off the film marked A,

760
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,189
exposing the adhesive coating.

761
00:31:31,288 --> 00:31:33,523
He then applies the strip
to Dave's palm.

762
00:31:33,624 --> 00:31:36,227
- Okay... -Aaron will then
remove the film marked B,

763
00:31:36,326 --> 00:31:38,229
exposing the ricin.

764
00:31:38,328 --> 00:31:39,328
- Clear.
- Okay, clear.

765
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,597
- Okay.
- Okay.

766
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,233
Dave needs to appear casual

767
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,335
as he is transferred
from his room

768
00:31:44,434 --> 00:31:46,303
- Okay.
- To the broadcast facility.

769
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:49,273
It is critical that he keeps
his hand open

770
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:50,508
and touches nothing.

771
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,945
Dave Skylark.

772
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,246
Mr. Kim...

773
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,147
Just shaking hands.

774
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,217
Hi.

775
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:00,652
Nice to meet you.

776
00:32:00,751 --> 00:32:02,686
Dave will bow to Kim

777
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,122
then shake his hand,

778
00:32:04,221 --> 00:32:06,156
immediately disposing
of the strip

779
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,493
in his jacket pocket,
which will be lined

780
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:12,096
with an absorbing agent
that denatures the poison.

781
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:33,951
Oh, no!

782
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:35,319
Hey! Hey!

783
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,653
Agent Lacey!

784
00:32:36,753 --> 00:32:38,423
- What's this mean?
- You're dead.

785
00:32:38,522 --> 00:32:40,242
All right, Mr. Skylark,
so you'll just place

786
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,460
the ricin case
in this pouch here.

787
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,599
It will magnetically seal,

788
00:32:43,693 --> 00:32:45,296
and then you're good to go.

789
00:32:45,395 --> 00:32:47,965
So you want me
to carry this bag?

790
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,167
This is the bag.

791
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,668
This is a douche bag.

792
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:54,072
The watches conceal
an array of tactical functions.

793
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:57,008
It's how you stay in contact
with me and the command center.

794
00:32:57,107 --> 00:32:58,408
- Aaron to Dave.
- All radio communication

795
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,411
should be done using call signs.

796
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,678
- Cool.
- Dave,

797
00:33:01,778 --> 00:33:03,146
you are "dung beetle,"

798
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,149
- What?
- And Aaron, you are "aardvark."

799
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:06,449
I can't even carry this thing!

800
00:33:06,483 --> 00:33:07,617
What do you mean
you can't carry it?

801
00:33:07,718 --> 00:33:08,720
Aerodynamics are all off.

802
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:09,619
It's hitting my leg.

803
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,322
It's, like, bulky.

804
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:14,392
Please remember, gentlemen,
you are entering into

805
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:18,028
the most dangerous and
unpredictable country on Earth.

806
00:33:18,128 --> 00:33:20,597
Kim Jong-un
is a master manipulator.

807
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:23,468
His people revere him as a god.

808
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:25,103
They'll believe anything

809
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:29,240
he tells them, including that
he can speak to dolphins

810
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:31,241
or he doesn't urinate
and defecate.

811
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,710
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

812
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:35,046
You're telling me my man
doesn't pee or poop?

813
00:33:35,145 --> 00:33:36,313
I'm telling you he does,
and he lies

814
00:33:36,413 --> 00:33:37,315
to his people
and they believe him.

815
00:33:37,414 --> 00:33:38,750
Everybody pees and poops.

816
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:40,650
Where would it go otherwise?
He'd explode.

817
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,185
But he does talk to dolphins.

818
00:34:01,738 --> 00:34:03,673
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

819
00:34:03,773 --> 00:34:05,342
All right, how do I look?

820
00:34:05,442 --> 00:34:06,743
Fucking awesome?

821
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,378
Yeah, actually, this
is really, really nice.

822
00:34:08,478 --> 00:34:10,347
- Yeah.
- And that just...

823
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:12,349
What the fuck is this?

824
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:13,750
- It's my bag.
- It's wonderful.

825
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,753
That's just not the bag
the CIA gave you.

826
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,221
Oh, that bag?

827
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,556
Yes, that bag!

828
00:34:18,655 --> 00:34:20,215
That bag was Fugly
with a capital "Fug."

829
00:34:21,224 --> 00:34:21,759
Well, it was also designed
to conceal fucking poison

830
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,561
that we're gonna smuggle
into a foreign country.

831
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:25,362
Kim is a super fan.

832
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,165
He knows I take fashion risks.

833
00:34:27,264 --> 00:34:28,298
Look, I show up
with that other bag,

834
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:29,467
Kim's gonna be like,

835
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,768
"Oh, no.

836
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:32,670
"You got ugly bag?

837
00:34:32,769 --> 00:34:34,172
"You no Skylark,
you secret agent.

838
00:34:34,271 --> 00:34:35,505
Terminate him."

839
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,075
Where's the fucking
poison strip?

840
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:40,178
I put the strip
in a pack of gum.

841
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:41,645
They'll never find it.

842
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,746
I am not cool with this.

843
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:44,515
- It's showtime.
- Showtime?

844
00:34:44,614 --> 00:34:46,250
It's not showtime.

845
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:47,518
- What are you doing? Stop.
- "Dave Skylark Tonight!"

846
00:34:47,617 --> 00:34:48,652
Stop walking!

847
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,121
- Stop walking.
- Hello.

848
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,556
We are going to North Korea.

849
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:52,824
Yo, Skylark, which side

850
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:54,525
of President Kim's ass
you gonna kiss?

851
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,527
I'm not gonna kiss him,
but let's just say

852
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:58,695
I might give him
something special with my hand.

853
00:34:58,795 --> 00:35:00,263
You gonna jerk him off?

854
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:01,798
What? No.
That's a double entendre.

855
00:35:01,898 --> 00:35:03,266
Shut the fuck... Shut up!

856
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,335
- I'm foreshadowing!
- Shut up!

857
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:05,702
Shut up!
Get in the fucking car!

858
00:35:05,802 --> 00:35:07,672
Shut up! Shut up!

859
00:35:07,771 --> 00:35:10,440
Why would you say that?
Why would you say that?

860
00:35:16,313 --> 00:35:17,681
All right, here we go.

861
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:20,818
What's that noise?

862
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,353
- I don't know.
- Do you hear that?

863
00:35:22,452 --> 00:35:23,588
Yeah.

864
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,664
Wow.

865
00:35:35,865 --> 00:35:37,168
This is crazy.

866
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:41,172
- Hello, North Korea!
- Wow.

867
00:35:41,271 --> 00:35:42,273
This is crazy.

868
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:43,740
Okay, okay.

869
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,609
- North side!
- Okay.

870
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:49,313
Hi. Sorry about...
what he's doing.

871
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,449
Hello!
Wow...

872
00:35:51,548 --> 00:35:53,451
I like your style.

873
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,188
Good to see you again.
How are you?

874
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,623
- Hi.
- Hello.

875
00:35:58,722 --> 00:36:00,224
- Hello.
- This is great.

876
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,592
Uh, Dave, this is, uh,
Sook-yin Park.

877
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:03,895
- Sook? The Sook?
- Yes, yes.

878
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:05,462
That you won't stop
talking about?

879
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,398
That's not true.

880
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,750
We are different people.

881
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:27,951
We speak different languages.

882
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,787
Huh?

883
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,423
We have different faces,

884
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,259
but inside

885
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:37,694
we are same-same.

886
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,664
Same-same, but different.

887
00:36:40,764 --> 00:36:42,666
But still same.

888
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,369
Oh, thank you.

889
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:46,938
Konichiwa.

890
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,507
You know, I'm very,

891
00:36:49,606 --> 00:36:52,275
very interested in the history
of your young nation.

892
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,711
I hear that

893
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,347
absolutely everyone here
is-is starving to death.

894
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,748
No.

895
00:36:57,847 --> 00:36:59,916
It's quite all right.

896
00:37:00,016 --> 00:37:01,518
This is a common misconception.

897
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,821
Oh, okay.

898
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,920
See for yourself.

899
00:37:08,057 --> 00:37:09,860
Oh, wow!
It's a grocery store.

900
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,662
Looks like the Whole Foods
around the corner from my place.

901
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:14,731
Yep, guess no one's
hungry here after all.

902
00:37:14,831 --> 00:37:17,100
We have an abundance
of food here.

903
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:18,936
And speak of the devil,
look at that fat kid!

904
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:20,738
Hi, little fatty!

905
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,940
Hi. Mm-mm!

906
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,677
We have many fat children
in North Korea.

907
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:27,777
The Supreme Leader

908
00:37:27,844 --> 00:37:29,279
believes it is a hallmark

909
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,015
of prosperity
and self-sufficiency.

910
00:37:31,114 --> 00:37:32,849
I don't know about all that,

911
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:34,818
but this one is one
that I heard.

912
00:37:34,918 --> 00:37:36,686
I heard he doesn't pee or poo.

913
00:37:36,786 --> 00:37:40,390
He works so hard,
he burns the energy from inside.

914
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,690
You-You're telling me my man
doesn't have to take a poo?

915
00:37:42,726 --> 00:37:43,960
Does-does he have
a butthole?

916
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,896
He does not have a butthole.

917
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:47,999
He has no need for one.

918
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:26,903
Whoa!

919
00:38:27,003 --> 00:38:28,639
Ho-ho! Damn, son!

920
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:29,807
Damn...

921
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,475
Right this way.

922
00:38:36,612 --> 00:38:38,815
I get it. Fucking stop it.

923
00:38:52,561 --> 00:38:55,665
These are
Officers Koh and Yu.

924
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:56,867
They are the heads of

925
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:59,903
our Supreme Leader's
personal security.

926
00:39:00,003 --> 00:39:02,373
They have been with him
since he was a little boy.

927
00:39:02,472 --> 00:39:03,940
They will search you
one last time

928
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,777
before entering
our Supreme Leader's home.

929
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,581
Just a Gucci bag.

930
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,059
What's this?

931
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,061
Uh...

932
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:25,061
gum.

933
00:39:25,161 --> 00:39:26,396
That is gum.

934
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:33,903
Oh, you fucking tried it?

935
00:39:34,003 --> 00:39:35,839
This gun has no flavor.

936
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,907
- If you don't like it, just spit
it out. -Just spit it out.

937
00:39:38,007 --> 00:39:39,887
We wouldn't be insulted
if you just spat it out.

938
00:39:40,777 --> 00:39:42,145
Your gum taste like shit.

939
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,548
Okay.

940
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,751
You may now enter the
Supreme Leader's home.

941
00:39:52,956 --> 00:39:54,158
This room

942
00:39:54,257 --> 00:39:56,159
- for Mr. Skylark.
- Cool.

943
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,162
Thanks.

944
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,099
This room for Mr. Rapoport.

945
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,501
Ooh, lovely.

946
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:04,835
- Thank you. Quaint.
- Cute.

947
00:40:04,934 --> 00:40:05,936
You know, I'm tired.

948
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:07,704
How are you feeling?

949
00:40:07,804 --> 00:40:09,572
- We go now.
- Okay.

950
00:40:09,672 --> 00:40:11,441
Dude, what the fuck?

951
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:13,143
Hey, uh, you know,

952
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,912
- how's your tummy feeling?
- You should have some Tums.

953
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:15,980
Maybe you should
have some tea.

954
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,114
Fuck.

955
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:18,213
- Shh.
- Shh.

956
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,617
They could be recording.

957
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,885
- Oh, the thing.
- The thing, all right, go.

958
00:40:21,985 --> 00:40:23,753
- Oh, uh...
- Lovely room.

959
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:25,556
- Yeah.
- Oh, yes.

960
00:40:25,655 --> 00:40:26,923
Lovely. I'm gonna go
take a shower now.

961
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:28,893
Okay, I'll take
one with you.

962
00:40:28,992 --> 00:40:30,527
Why would you
take one with me?

963
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:31,562
I'm just making up
fake conversation.

964
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:32,661
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up.

965
00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:37,168
What... the... fuck... dude?

966
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,970
He ate it.
He fucking ate it.

967
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,672
- You're not even supposed
to touch it. -And he ate it.

968
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:44,174
- Chewing. Chewing it!
- Shit! Fuck.

969
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,809
Shit, he's gonna die.

970
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:47,510
Look, look, look, look...

971
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,013
He's probably, like,
Kim's trigger man, okay?

972
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,794
He's probably killed,
like, tons of people.

973
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,150
He's probably worse than Kim,

974
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,018
and we're okay
with killing Kim, right?

975
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,653
Yeah.

976
00:40:56,753 --> 00:40:58,553
How the fuck are we gonna
do that, by the way?

977
00:40:58,588 --> 00:40:59,757
We don't have
any poison anymore.

978
00:40:59,856 --> 00:41:01,592
What happened to it?

979
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,092
- Somebody ate it.
- Someone ate it?

980
00:41:03,126 --> 00:41:05,061
Why the fuck did you
switch bags?

981
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:06,896
- Yeah, Dave!
- All right, all right!

982
00:41:06,996 --> 00:41:09,065
I shouldn't have switched
the bags. I'm sorry.

983
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,686
- I told you.
- Listen, just sit tight.

984
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,202
I am going to contact you.

985
00:41:12,302 --> 00:41:14,103
Do not fall asleep.

986
00:41:14,204 --> 00:41:16,173
I'm gonna figure out
a way to fix this.

987
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:17,708
Thanks.
Why'd you tell her?

988
00:41:17,807 --> 00:41:18,909
Tell her what?
Because it's the truth.

989
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:19,976
Why'd you tell her
that he ate it?

990
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,178
Because he did!

991
00:41:21,277 --> 00:41:24,547
Dude, that was a cock block.

992
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,916
Get me Major Franks
at the Osan Air Force Base.

993
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:56,614
ETA to launch zone, 20 minutes.

994
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:00,301
We have a bird en route.

995
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,153
It will be within range of you
in 15 minutes.

996
00:42:03,253 --> 00:42:04,555
Aardvark,

997
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,657
your watch will transmit
the coordinates

998
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:08,157
to guide in the package.

999
00:42:08,257 --> 00:42:10,627
You need to get outside
to a place with no tree cover

1000
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:11,695
where you can't be detected.

1001
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:13,163
Okay?

1002
00:42:13,262 --> 00:42:14,965
What-what-what...?
Lacey, why do I have to do it?

1003
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,233
Why you?

1004
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,068
Because if Dung Beetle
gets caught

1005
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,570
or killed, then we don't have
a mission anymore, do we?

1006
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,306
You really think I could
get caught or killed?

1007
00:42:22,405 --> 00:42:25,074
Hey, put on your darkest clothes
and get outside now

1008
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,610
and make sure that you are

1009
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,310
at least 20 yards away
from the building.

1010
00:42:31,847 --> 00:42:33,750
Approaching launch zone.

1011
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,925
You ready?

1012
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,326
I think so.

1013
00:42:42,425 --> 00:42:44,105
I'm a little nervous,
but I'm feeling okay.

1014
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:45,596
- Okay, okay.
- I think I can do it.

1015
00:42:48,097 --> 00:42:49,697
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna cherish

1016
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:51,601
- all the memories we have.
- Don't do this!

1017
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,337
- What? -Talk to me
like I'm about to die, okay?

1018
00:42:53,436 --> 00:42:55,338
- I'm gonna be fine!
- All right. I know.

1019
00:42:55,438 --> 00:42:57,141
I'm trying to psych myself up
here; you're bringing me down.

1020
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,643
I will love your mother
like she was my mother.

1021
00:42:59,742 --> 00:43:01,010
- Just shut up. Shut up.
- Okay.

1022
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,145
Shh.

1023
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,183
It's really scary out there.

1024
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:08,751
Yeah, super-duper scary.

1025
00:43:08,851 --> 00:43:10,371
- Be careful.
- Okay, good. You got me?

1026
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:12,122
- I got you. I will not drop you.
- Okay.

1027
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:13,357
- Yeah, just don't drop me.
- I got you.

1028
00:43:13,456 --> 00:43:14,891
I got... Oh!

1029
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,296
Aardvark, are you all right?

1030
00:43:21,164 --> 00:43:22,766
I'm fine. Shut the fuck up.

1031
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,971
Aardvark is hot.

1032
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:30,039
I repeat: Aardvark is H-O-T hot.

1033
00:43:40,315 --> 00:43:42,051
- This is so scary.
- Aardvark?

1034
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,820
You're being extremely brave.

1035
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,089
Everybody here
is very proud of you.

1036
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,392
- My tummy's all scraped up
and wet. -Aardvark,

1037
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:50,361
I'm gonna rub your tummy
when you get back, don't worry.

1038
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,061
Just a few more feet, okay?

1039
00:43:52,161 --> 00:43:54,163
Just five to ten more feet.

1040
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:55,399
I got to keep going?

1041
00:43:55,498 --> 00:43:56,799
I don't want to keep going.

1042
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,335
Fuck.

1043
00:43:58,434 --> 00:44:03,139
Package will deploy
in three, two, one, boom.

1044
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:05,708
Package is inbound.

1045
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,711
Arrival time, two minutes.

1046
00:44:09,344 --> 00:44:10,780
Just five more feet.

1047
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,815
Five more feet,
and you're on your mark.

1048
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,184
Hey, hey,

1049
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,086
hey, don't move.

1050
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:18,122
I think I see something.

1051
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:20,357
- Huh?
- There's something out there.

1052
00:44:20,456 --> 00:44:22,259
What do you mean,
there's something out there?

1053
00:44:22,358 --> 00:44:24,027
What is it?
Can you zoom in on that?

1054
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:25,729
What do I do?

1055
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,431
Comm One, are you seeing this?

1056
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:28,398
Zoom in one that thing.

1057
00:44:28,498 --> 00:44:30,299
What is that?

1058
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,120
There's something crawling
towards Aardvark.

1059
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,171
What the fuck? What is it?
Talk to me.

1060
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:37,207
I'm seeing four legs
connected to one body.

1061
00:44:37,306 --> 00:44:39,442
What the fuck are you seeing?
I'm not seeing anything.

1062
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:41,245
Dog, big dog.

1063
00:44:41,344 --> 00:44:43,846
- Big dog?
- It's like Clifford size.

1064
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,849
We're talking Falkor
in "The Neverending Story."

1065
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:47,117
It's like a dragon dog.

1066
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:48,318
This is like a dragon dog.

1067
00:44:48,418 --> 00:44:50,988
Is that a fucking...

1068
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,289
Guys, what am I looking for?
I don't know...

1069
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:53,923
It's like a big dog

1070
00:44:54,023 --> 00:44:55,159
that's orange.

1071
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:56,726
It's got stripes.

1072
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:59,129
It's like a big, orange,
stripey dog.

1073
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:06,003
There's a tiger.

1074
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:07,403
It's a fucking tiger.

1075
00:45:07,503 --> 00:45:08,871
It's a fucking tiger.

1076
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:10,040
Yes.

1077
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:11,474
A tiger.

1078
00:45:11,574 --> 00:45:14,010
You fucking led my friend
into a tiger patch?

1079
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,211
I told you
there were tigers there.

1080
00:45:15,311 --> 00:45:17,014
Guys, I'm very unhappy
right now.

1081
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:18,014
Look, it's really dark
out there.

1082
00:45:18,114 --> 00:45:19,248
He probably doesn't see you.

1083
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:21,785
Oh, it fucking sees me.

1084
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,354
- It ha... it has night vision.
- They have night vision?

1085
00:45:24,454 --> 00:45:26,323
That tiger has
night vision goggles?

1086
00:45:26,422 --> 00:45:27,924
It doesn't have
night vision goggles.

1087
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,860
It just naturally has night...

1088
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,260
- -Listen,
just keep the line clear,

1089
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,429
Dung Beetle, please?

1090
00:45:32,528 --> 00:45:34,264
Aardvark is in trouble.

1091
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:35,898
What do I do? What do I do?

1092
00:45:35,998 --> 00:45:37,300
Talk to me, talk to me.

1093
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,935
I didn't want it
to come to this,

1094
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,170
but you're gonna have
to fight that tiger.

1095
00:45:40,269 --> 00:45:42,271
No, do not!
Do not fight the tiger!

1096
00:45:42,371 --> 00:45:44,774
Do not be a gentleman, you go
right for the fucking balls.

1097
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,175
I don't see its balls.

1098
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:47,877
Do not fight the tiger!
You will lose!

1099
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:50,180
If that's a girl tiger,
you got to cunt punt that bitch.

1100
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,440
- Dave, shut the fuck up.
- Cunt punt that fucking bitch!

1101
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,184
Please tell me you know
that that's a stupid idea.

1102
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:56,286
Please, please don't try
to fight the tiger.

1103
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,057
I'm gonna make a run for it.

1104
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:01,157
Do not run for it!

1105
00:46:01,224 --> 00:46:02,224
You will die.

1106
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,460
It's coming.

1107
00:46:04,893 --> 00:46:06,362
You go, go, go, buddy!
Go, buddy!

1108
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:07,798
Look out, look out!
It's coming after you!

1109
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:08,932
It's coming after you!

1110
00:46:21,476 --> 00:46:23,480
- Oh, God, I'm alive.
- Aaron!

1111
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:25,481
I'm alive.

1112
00:46:25,581 --> 00:46:26,821
Are you in the tiger, Aardvark?

1113
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:28,085
Are you inside the tiger?

1114
00:46:28,184 --> 00:46:29,184
Are you okay?

1115
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,320
Do you have the package?

1116
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,956
This is Aardvark.

1117
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:35,016
I think the package just killed
the fucking tiger.

1118
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:37,961
Fantastic.
You have to secure the package.

1119
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:39,496
Secure
the motherfucking package.

1120
00:46:45,534 --> 00:46:47,870
He's got the package.
He has the package.

1121
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,273
I got it; what do I do with it?

1122
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:50,407
Aardvark,
there are people coming.

1123
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:51,942
You have to act now.

1124
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:53,576
Secure the package,
secure the package.

1125
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,312
- What do I do with it? -They're
coming right towards you.

1126
00:46:55,411 --> 00:46:56,512
They're gonna see it,
they're gonna see it.

1127
00:46:56,612 --> 00:46:57,547
You got to hide
that little missile.

1128
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,916
I have to hide it somewhere?

1129
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,136
Where the fuck do I hide it?

1130
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:04,855
What do I do with it?
What do I do with it?

1131
00:47:07,322 --> 00:47:09,425
What if you hide it
in your butt?

1132
00:47:11,027 --> 00:47:13,530
I don't want to stick it
in my ass.

1133
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,298
You got to put it
in your butt, Aardvark.

1134
00:47:15,398 --> 00:47:16,365
Comm One, please tell me
I don't have

1135
00:47:16,465 --> 00:47:17,433
to stick this think in my ass.

1136
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:18,969
Okay, you're right. Just give us

1137
00:47:19,068 --> 00:47:20,436
one second
to come up with a better plan.

1138
00:47:20,536 --> 00:47:22,872
Isn't there anywhere else
I could secure it?

1139
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:24,875
I think he should put it
in his asshole.

1140
00:47:24,974 --> 00:47:26,175
We don't have a better plan.
You're going to have

1141
00:47:26,275 --> 00:47:27,310
to stick it in your ass.

1142
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:29,278
No! No!

1143
00:47:29,378 --> 00:47:30,547
No!

1144
00:47:30,646 --> 00:47:32,481
I've never done that.

1145
00:47:32,581 --> 00:47:34,083
I've been there before.
It looks huge.

1146
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,620
That tiger blood
will lubricate it.

1147
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:38,288
This will mess up my asshole!

1148
00:47:38,387 --> 00:47:40,423
Aardvark,
there-there are people there.

1149
00:47:40,523 --> 00:47:41,991
They are closing in on you.

1150
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,093
They have guns.

1151
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,429
You need to secure the payload

1152
00:47:45,528 --> 00:47:46,896
and you need
to secure it in your ass.

1153
00:47:46,996 --> 00:47:47,897
Just stick it in your butt.

1154
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:49,298
Okay, fine, fine.

1155
00:47:49,398 --> 00:47:50,933
I'm there with you, bro.

1156
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,970
Just listen to the soothing
tones of my voice.

1157
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,071
Just breathe.

1158
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,338
Oh, it's cold.

1159
00:47:55,438 --> 00:47:56,639
Just let everything go loose.

1160
00:47:56,739 --> 00:47:57,573
Oh, I don't like it!

1161
00:47:57,673 --> 00:47:59,342
The tip is...

1162
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:00,944
it's the worst part.

1163
00:48:01,043 --> 00:48:02,311
Trust me on this.

1164
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:03,579
Inhale as you do it.

1165
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,117
The tip of the package
is secure.

1166
00:48:08,217 --> 00:48:09,952
Comm One,
that thing is in his butt.

1167
00:48:10,052 --> 00:48:12,054
Owie, owie.

1168
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:14,191
You are almost
in the end zone, Aardvark.

1169
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,359
Just take it home.

1170
00:48:23,532 --> 00:48:25,201
The package is secure.

1171
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:26,436
You are a hero.

1172
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,238
You are a goddamn hero.

1173
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:29,373
- -All right,
they're coming, they're coming.

1174
00:48:29,472 --> 00:48:31,240
I got to go. Over and out.

1175
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:34,510
Hi! Aah! Don't shoot me.

1176
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:35,610
Oh, God!

1177
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:47,157
Don't hurt me, please!

1178
00:48:48,257 --> 00:48:49,259
See? There's nothing in here.

1179
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:50,358
There's nothing in here.

1180
00:48:50,393 --> 00:48:52,395
What?

1181
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:53,697
Oh, God, no!

1182
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:56,132
Ow!

1183
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:57,301
Come on!

1184
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,501
What the fuck?

1185
00:48:58,601 --> 00:49:00,636
Why? Why'd you do that?

1186
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:01,737
Why'd you do that?!

1187
00:49:01,771 --> 00:49:03,239
Is this what you want?

1188
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,008
There! You like it?!

1189
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,576
You like it?!

1190
00:49:06,675 --> 00:49:09,112
It's all yours, fuckers!

1191
00:49:09,211 --> 00:49:10,291
Stay in the room, American.

1192
00:49:18,721 --> 00:49:21,992
Hey, they're gone.
Did they look in your butt?

1193
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,126
- No, they didn't look in
my butt. -It's still in there?

1194
00:49:24,226 --> 00:49:26,096
- Yes, it's in there.
- Wow. Must be deep.

1195
00:49:26,195 --> 00:49:28,130
- It is.
- Get it out.

1196
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:29,599
I'm gonna fucking get it out.

1197
00:49:29,699 --> 00:49:31,434
I'm here to help.

1198
00:49:49,284 --> 00:49:51,120
Hey.

1199
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:53,423
- How'd it go? -One ricin strip
with your name on it.

1200
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:54,524
Got it.

1201
00:49:54,623 --> 00:49:56,759
All right.

1202
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,128
See, not so bad.

1203
00:49:58,228 --> 00:49:59,695
Yeah, not so bad.

1204
00:49:59,795 --> 00:50:01,163
- What?!
- Yeah.

1205
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:02,298
- That?
- This.

1206
00:50:02,398 --> 00:50:03,467
- In your bu...?
- Asshole.

1207
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,469
- No!
- Yes.

1208
00:50:05,568 --> 00:50:06,469
I was picturing
something, like, this big.

1209
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:07,730
Yeah, that I could live with.

1210
00:50:07,737 --> 00:50:09,172
As soon as you get home,

1211
00:50:09,271 --> 00:50:10,239
you need to see a proctologist.

1212
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,420
I'm afraid to fucking look.

1213
00:50:11,474 --> 00:50:13,342
You got fucked by RoboCop, dude.

1214
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,780
Uh, who is it?

1215
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,615
It is, uh, Kim Jong-un.

1216
00:50:19,715 --> 00:50:21,150
What?

1217
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:24,321
Kim Jong-what?

1218
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:27,156
I am the Supreme Leader of,
uh, North Korea.

1219
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:28,358
What?

1220
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:29,659
What the fuck?

1221
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,061
- It's him.
- It's fucking him.

1222
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,229
What is he doing here?
What the fuck?

1223
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:33,369
Hide it, hide it, hide it.

1224
00:50:33,429 --> 00:50:34,429
- Put it back up.
- No.

1225
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:35,511
I'm not putting it back up.

1226
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,167
No, I'm gonna hide it
in my room.

1227
00:50:37,266 --> 00:50:38,467
- Okay. What do I do with this?
- Go say hi to him.

1228
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:39,435
Do I put it on right now?

1229
00:50:39,534 --> 00:50:41,170
No, then he'll die
when we're still here.

1230
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,271
Put it in your pocket.

1231
00:50:42,338 --> 00:50:43,472
- Okay, fine.
- Okay, fine.

1232
00:50:43,572 --> 00:50:45,275
- Come with me.
- No, I got to hide this.

1233
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,110
- Aaron, just come with me.
- No, no...

1234
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,246
Aaron, Aaron.

1235
00:50:56,518 --> 00:50:58,754
Hi.

1236
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:01,123
Good morning, Dave.

1237
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,526
Good morning.

1238
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:04,361
Hi.

1239
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,529
Dave Skylark, ah.

1240
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,131
It's crazy.

1241
00:51:09,865 --> 00:51:11,300
Oh, I have a gift for you.

1242
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,435
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1243
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:15,105
This.

1244
00:51:15,204 --> 00:51:17,173
Oh, oh, this is me.

1245
00:51:17,273 --> 00:51:18,273
It's you.

1246
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,608
Oh, that's great.

1247
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:22,244
I always wanted
one of these... a bust.

1248
00:51:22,344 --> 00:51:23,679
Dave Skylark.

1249
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,781
Hey!

1250
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,315
- Thank you.
- You like that?

1251
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,784
So you really like the show?

1252
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:29,786
No, I might not show it,
but I'm freaking out.

1253
00:51:29,885 --> 00:51:31,153
You're like a superfan.

1254
00:51:31,253 --> 00:51:32,721
I really am.

1255
00:51:32,822 --> 00:51:34,124
Yeah.

1256
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:35,692
That's so cool.

1257
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:38,127
Don't say something stupid, Kim.

1258
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:40,697
Okay, so I, uh,

1259
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:44,134
thought you might enjoy,
uh, breakfast

1260
00:51:44,233 --> 00:51:45,735
and a tour of my home.

1261
00:51:45,835 --> 00:51:47,804
I'd absolutely love to.

1262
00:51:49,271 --> 00:51:52,375
You know, I have to admit,
before I came here,

1263
00:51:52,407 --> 00:51:54,543
I thought this place
was gonna be a dump.

1264
00:51:54,643 --> 00:51:56,212
Of course.

1265
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:58,581
For decades, you've heard
the false rumors:

1266
00:51:58,681 --> 00:52:00,583
"North Korea
is a failed state.

1267
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:02,619
We can't feed our people."

1268
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,454
- Yeah.
- It's all propaganda.

1269
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:06,423
I see.
Well, yeah, I mean...

1270
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:08,291
I did see a fat kid

1271
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:10,327
and a really nice-looking
grocery store.

1272
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:13,463
Oh, we have beautiful grocery
stores here in North Korea.

1273
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:15,465
You know, one of my
favorite things to do

1274
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,767
is just strolling up
and down the aisles

1275
00:52:17,867 --> 00:52:20,303
to see the-the beautiful fruits
of my country's land.

1276
00:52:20,402 --> 00:52:21,737
I can believe that.

1277
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:24,341
It looks like you hit
the grocery store pretty often.

1278
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,908
Screw you, Dave.

1279
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:28,478
- Hey, you want to see
something cool? -Yeah.

1280
00:52:39,454 --> 00:52:41,557
Holy fuck-a-moley!

1281
00:52:41,657 --> 00:52:43,726
Is that real?

1282
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,496
It was a gift to my
grandfather from Stalin.

1283
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:50,333
In my country,
it's pronounced "Stallone."

1284
00:52:50,432 --> 00:52:52,936
You're so funny, Dave.

1285
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:54,403
Uh, right.

1286
00:52:54,503 --> 00:52:56,572
Well, can we look inside?

1287
00:52:56,672 --> 00:52:58,340
Fuck, yeah, we can.

1288
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,609
Come on.

1289
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,345
This is so cool.

1290
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:04,414
- A tank!
- Yeah, a tank.

1291
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,414
Whoa.

1292
00:53:05,514 --> 00:53:06,782
Is it still live?

1293
00:53:06,882 --> 00:53:08,417
I don't know.

1294
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,686
Maybe we should find out.

1295
00:53:11,887 --> 00:53:13,356
Look... you have a...
sound system in here?

1296
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:17,193
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't... d-don't touch.

1297
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,499
- Katy Perry?
- Oh...

1298
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:25,535
Oh, uh... no, my wife
must have put that in there,

1299
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:28,205
'cause I've never heard this
before in my life.

1300
00:53:28,304 --> 00:53:29,538
I love Katy Perry!

00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:33,376

1304
00:53:37,746 --> 00:53:38,647
I listen to this all the time.

1305
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:41,384
- Really?
- I love her!

1306
00:53:41,483 --> 00:53:42,918
You know why I really like her?

1307
00:53:43,018 --> 00:53:45,321
'Cause... because she has
such a strong message

1308
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:48,625
for young women and girls
across the planet.

1309
00:53:48,724 --> 00:53:50,460
She's a... It's so empowering.

1310
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,394
Yeah.

1311
00:53:52,494 --> 00:53:56,398
You know, Dave, sometimes I feel
like a plastic bag.

1312
00:53:56,498 --> 00:53:58,834
Drifting through the wind?

1313
00:53:58,934 --> 00:54:01,471
Wanting to start again.

1314
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:02,938

- Yeah.
- Yeah. Uh, Dave?

1319
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:14,451
Do you think
that margaritas are gay

1320
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:16,418
because they are so sweet?

1321
00:54:16,518 --> 00:54:18,754
Did someone tell you that?
That margaritas are gay?

1322
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:21,490
No, it's just a question I have.

1323
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:24,661
If liking Katy Perry
and drinking margaritas is gay,

1324
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,695
then who wants to be straight?

1325
00:54:26,795 --> 00:54:28,498
- Not me.
- Boring!

1326
00:54:28,597 --> 00:54:30,432
Margaritas are great.

1327
00:54:30,532 --> 00:54:33,702
And whoever planted that
in your head is crazy.

1328
00:54:33,802 --> 00:54:36,272
Let me ask you something.

1329
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,442
Does this thing still run?

1330
00:54:58,393 --> 00:55:00,896
Oh, man, this is great, right?

1331
00:55:00,996 --> 00:55:02,699
Can we fire the gun?

1332
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:05,302
You think I'd tease you
and not take you all the way?

1333
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:06,503
- Really?
- Close that shit.

1334
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:08,471
- Closing the hatch.
- Okay.

1335
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:10,406
Boom, boom, boom!

1336
00:55:14,476 --> 00:55:16,045
Oh, shit!

1337
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,315
Fuck you, tree!

1338
00:55:19,547 --> 00:55:21,517
The control room
will be fully staffed

1339
00:55:21,617 --> 00:55:23,652
to insure an uninterrupted
transmission.

1340
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:25,021
All right.

1341
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:26,789
This is the kill switch.

1342
00:55:26,889 --> 00:55:29,958
During the interview,
if any parameters are violated,

1343
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:32,394
I will use it
and cut the signal.

1344
00:55:32,494 --> 00:55:34,364
Don't worry, we're gonna
stick with the program here.

1345
00:55:34,463 --> 00:55:37,366
I will be in charge of every
aspect of this transmission.

1346
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,702
Dave and the show itself
are very dependent on me

1347
00:55:39,802 --> 00:55:42,371
when it comes to how we
actually shoot the show.

1348
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:43,940
I know.
I've watched every episode

1349
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:45,909
in preparation
for this interview.

1350
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,009
Wow!

1351
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,044
I particularly enjoyed

1352
00:55:48,143 --> 00:55:50,579
the Miley Cyrus
camel toe episode.

1353
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:52,781
Oh, the camel toe episode.
That was good.

1354
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:54,918
I've never heard
this expression before.

1355
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,920
But after seeing it,
it is a perfect

1356
00:55:57,019 --> 00:55:59,588
representation of her vagina.

1357
00:55:59,688 --> 00:56:01,657
It is; it looked exactly
like that, yeah.

1358
00:56:01,757 --> 00:56:03,525
- It's very deep.
- Very deep. Yeah.

1359
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:04,793
She has quite a
hearty moose knuckle.

1360
00:56:04,893 --> 00:56:08,364
You Americans are so creative
with your sexual innuendos.

1361
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,700
- We do it very well.
- Many animal references.

1362
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,800
Oh, yes, tons.

1363
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:22,411
Please, take this printed copy
of the questions.

1364
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,614
It's crucial Dave review them
before the interview.

1365
00:56:24,713 --> 00:56:26,482
Officers Koh and Yu
will now take you

1366
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,550
to your room,
where you'll be served lunch.

1367
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:29,952
Come, American.
Time to get even fatter.

1368
00:56:30,052 --> 00:56:31,554
Oh, ha-ha. Great.

1369
00:56:31,653 --> 00:56:33,623
Thanks, guys.

1370
00:56:38,827 --> 00:56:41,130
Making you my little
Korean bitch!

1371
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,832
What are you gonna do?

1372
00:56:42,931 --> 00:56:44,400
You gonna drop
some nukes on L.A.?

1373
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:45,735
- Nuke your mama.
- I bet they can't even

1374
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:47,470
make it to Australia!

1375
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:50,874
Face!

1376
00:56:53,175 --> 00:56:56,112
Man, this is so nice.

1377
00:56:56,211 --> 00:56:58,581
Let me ask you something.

1378
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,416
Now, don't take this
the wrong way.

1379
00:57:00,516 --> 00:57:02,418
You can ask me anything, Dave.

1380
00:57:03,485 --> 00:57:05,454
Do you pee and poo?

1381
00:57:05,554 --> 00:57:07,190
You've heard the stories, huh?

1382
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:09,992
Yes, I pee and poo.

1383
00:57:10,092 --> 00:57:11,460
So you have a butthole.

1384
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:12,629
I've got a butthole,

1385
00:57:12,728 --> 00:57:14,431
and it's working overtime.

1386
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:15,864
You are awesome.

1387
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:18,134
You know, this is so weird.

1388
00:57:18,233 --> 00:57:20,737
You are, like,
the coolest guy.

1389
00:57:20,836 --> 00:57:22,172
But a lot of people

1390
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:24,173
say that...

1391
00:57:24,273 --> 00:57:25,875
you're bat-shit crazy.

1392
00:57:25,974 --> 00:57:28,844
They're not wrong.

1393
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:32,148
I'm 31 years old.

1394
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:36,052
The fact that I am running
a country is bat-shit crazy.

1395
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:37,854
Hey, what am I to do

1396
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,889
when 24 million people

1397
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:43,760
look to me as their
leader, their god?

1398
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:47,463
What am I to do
when my father's dying wish

1399
00:57:47,563 --> 00:57:50,165
was for me to carry his torch?

1400
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:51,432
Wow.

1401
00:57:53,568 --> 00:57:55,971
You want to know what my father
said to me on his deathbed?

1402
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:57,807
What did he say, Dave?

1403
00:57:57,907 --> 00:57:59,209
"I'm disappointed,

1404
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,644
because you haven't done
enough with your life."

1405
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:04,079
That is fucked up.

1406
00:58:04,179 --> 00:58:05,714
Yeah, tell me about it.

1407
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:06,983
Jordan!

1408
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:10,220
Oh!

1409
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,789
- They call me incompetent.
- That's exactly what they

1410
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:16,059
- said about me when I scored
this interview. -No way.

1411
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:19,496
They said, "Dave Skylark
is stupid and incompetent."

1412
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:21,197
You're handsome,
competent, suave.

1413
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:22,831
How dare they!

1414
00:58:22,931 --> 00:58:27,135
I pretend like their insults
don't get to me.

1415
00:58:27,235 --> 00:58:28,904
But they do.

1416
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:32,242
You know what's more destructive
than a nuclear bomb?

1417
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,277
Words.

1418
00:58:34,376 --> 00:58:38,146
And the people are jealous
of men like you and me.

1419
00:58:38,246 --> 00:58:42,618
It's as though they despise us
because they are not us.

1420
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,823
Hate us 'cause they ain't us.

1421
00:58:46,922 --> 00:58:48,824
Exactly.

1422
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:50,760
They hate us
because they ain't us.

1423
00:58:53,494 --> 00:58:55,697
- That's a great saying, okay?
- Hate us 'cause they ain't us!

1424
00:58:55,797 --> 00:58:57,299
They hate us
because they ain't us.

1425
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:00,837
Kim! You got it, boy!

1426
00:59:00,936 --> 00:59:02,572
Okay. Okay. Alley-oop!

1427
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:03,907
Oh!

1428
00:59:05,139 --> 00:59:06,775
That's all right.

1429
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,278
- That's all right.
- Oh, my ankles.

1430
00:59:09,378 --> 00:59:11,114
- Okay.
- Hey, Kim.

1431
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:15,050
Let me ask you something.

1432
00:59:18,152 --> 00:59:22,591
Was your father the one who said
that margaritas are gay?

1433
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:27,730
He said that my brothers and I
were all too feminine.

1434
00:59:27,829 --> 00:59:32,134
That our luxurious lifestyles
turned us into homosexuals.

1435
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:38,173
I don't have to worry
about that anymore.

1436
00:59:38,273 --> 00:59:41,743
Because guess what
I get tons of.

1437
00:59:44,179 --> 00:59:45,782
Pussy.

1438
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:47,983
Oh, my God.

1439
01:00:21,315 --> 01:00:22,918
Hey.

1440
01:00:23,018 --> 01:00:24,786
Dude, you just spent
the fucking day

1441
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:25,989
with Kim Jong-un.
What happened?

1442
01:00:26,088 --> 01:00:27,222
Ah...

1443
01:00:27,322 --> 01:00:28,857
It was amazing.

1444
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,660
- "It was amazing"?
- Yeah.

1445
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,062
I think it was one of
the best days of my life.

1446
01:00:33,161 --> 01:00:34,730
- What?
- We smoked joints,

1447
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:36,865
played basketball,

1448
01:00:36,965 --> 01:00:38,333
fucked chicks.

1449
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:40,136
We had the best margaritas.

1450
01:00:40,235 --> 01:00:42,137
Did you say you fucked chicks?

1451
01:00:42,237 --> 01:00:43,338
Oh, my God.

1452
01:00:43,438 --> 01:00:46,742
Kim Jong is an animal.

1453
01:00:46,842 --> 01:00:48,978
You know you have to kill this
fucking guy tomorrow, right?

1454
01:00:49,077 --> 01:00:52,414
I've been thinking a little bit
about the mission.

1455
01:00:52,514 --> 01:00:53,815
Okay.

1456
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,852
America, you know,

1457
01:00:55,952 --> 01:01:00,657
always puttin' its nose
in things and screwin' 'em up.

1458
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:03,860
The truth is, Kim is a master
at manipulating the media.

1459
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,961
- Yeah.
- You're the media.

1460
01:01:06,061 --> 01:01:07,730
You get what's happening here?

1461
01:01:07,829 --> 01:01:09,731
Maybe the media's
manipulating you.

1462
01:01:09,831 --> 01:01:11,400
"Maybe the media's manip..."?

1463
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,403
What the fuck does
that even mean?

1464
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:16,105
I'm the only one who's spent
real time with him, all right?

1465
01:01:16,204 --> 01:01:18,106
Spent face-to-face time.

1466
01:01:18,206 --> 01:01:19,442
Dick-to-dick.

1467
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:22,244
It's just, man,
I can sympathize

1468
01:01:22,344 --> 01:01:24,880
with people that get dumped on
by the media... and it sucks.

1469
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,050
Well, you know
what else fuckin' sucks?

1470
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:30,720
Concentration camps, famine,
firing squads...

1471
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:31,721
I didn't see any here.
Have you?

1472
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:32,820
No.

1473
01:01:34,188 --> 01:01:36,458
Your attendance is required
in the banquet room

1474
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,294
of the Eternal Leader.

1475
01:01:38,393 --> 01:01:39,995
- Hey, how you doing?
- Yeah, seriously.

1476
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:42,264
You are looking fantastic.

1477
01:01:42,364 --> 01:01:44,266
Your unhealthy obsession
with my well-being

1478
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,436
is only making me more
suspicious of you two.

1479
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,104
- You don't have to be
suspicious. -DAVE: Oh, no, no.

1480
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,872
I just want to know what
your routine is, man.

1481
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:51,874
You look fantastic.
Do you take vitamins or...?

1482
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:53,042
- You're doin' somethin' right.
- Yeah, you look good.

1483
01:01:53,141 --> 01:01:54,409
Do not ask us
any more question.

1484
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,913
Meet us in
the banquet hall.

1485
01:02:31,512 --> 01:02:35,451
You see how big their guitars
are compared to their bodies?

1486
01:02:37,552 --> 01:02:39,154
I think it's funny.

1487
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,990
That is funny.

1488
01:02:48,262 --> 01:02:50,165
Oh, no.

1489
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:52,401
It's happening.

1490
01:02:58,206 --> 01:03:00,876
Dave.

1491
01:03:02,077 --> 01:03:03,379
Dave.

1492
01:03:06,114 --> 01:03:07,114
No.

1493
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,963
- Wait, what?
- Look at the fu...

1494
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:22,831
They're good.

1495
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:28,805
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1496
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:30,273
Caw, caw.

1497
01:03:39,014 --> 01:03:41,217
- What do we do?
- He's gonna poo.

1498
01:03:56,932 --> 01:04:00,001
Oh, no. Oh, no.

1499
01:04:00,101 --> 01:04:01,903
Oh, shit. Oh, no. Oh, no.

1500
01:04:06,173 --> 01:04:07,909
It's happening.

1501
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,626
So gross.

1502
01:04:27,128 --> 01:04:29,164
Oh, no, no, no.

1503
01:04:29,264 --> 01:04:32,033
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1504
01:04:38,373 --> 01:04:42,043
Oh, no. Oh, no.

1505
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:54,189
It's okay, man.

1506
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:55,458
No.

1507
01:04:55,557 --> 01:04:56,893
Come on, man.

1508
01:04:56,992 --> 01:04:59,327
We just killed two innocent men.

1509
01:04:59,427 --> 01:05:00,929
Look, Dave, first of all,

1510
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:02,999
it's not your fault
that those men died.

1511
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:04,467
Second of all, they had to go.

1512
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:05,902
They knew we were
up to something.

1513
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:10,206
- I'm out.
- What?

1514
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:12,226
- You cannot pull out of this.
- I'm pulling out.

1515
01:05:12,307 --> 01:05:13,643
- You're way too deep
to pull out. -I'm pullin' out.

1516
01:05:13,742 --> 01:05:15,076
No, you are not.
You are leaving it in.

1517
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:16,545
I been pullin' out
for years, son.

1518
01:05:16,644 --> 01:05:19,014
You are not fucking
pulling out of this mission.

1519
01:05:19,114 --> 01:05:20,282
That's the only reason
we're here.

1520
01:05:20,382 --> 01:05:21,650
We are doing this!

1521
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,019
Kim is not evil.

1522
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,653
He was just born
into a hard situation.

1523
01:05:24,753 --> 01:05:27,690
You are fucking stupid, and you
are fucking ignorant, Dave.

1524
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:33,128
- Mm!
- Ugh!

1525
01:05:33,228 --> 01:05:35,096
- Who you calling ign'ant?
- You, motherfucker.

1526
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:37,532
You're fuckin' arrogant.

1527
01:05:37,632 --> 01:05:39,401
Everything he's
shown you is fake.

1528
01:05:39,501 --> 01:05:41,503
He's shown you
what you want to see.

1529
01:05:41,603 --> 01:05:43,105
He's fooled you,
you fucking idiot!

1530
01:05:43,204 --> 01:05:46,375
God, look how ready
you are to betray me.

1531
01:05:46,474 --> 01:05:50,112
This whole time I thought you
were Samwise to my Frodo.

1532
01:05:50,211 --> 01:05:52,514
But you're just Boromir.

1533
01:05:52,614 --> 01:05:54,049
I don't know
who the fuck that is.

1534
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:55,350
"I don't know who Boromir is."

1535
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:56,519
That's such a Boromir thing
to say.

1536
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,987
This is fuckin' done.

1537
01:05:58,086 --> 01:05:59,521
You are fuckin' done
after this.

1538
01:05:59,621 --> 01:06:01,990
Once you kill this motherfucker,
this shit's over.

1539
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:03,558
But you are going to kill him!

1540
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:05,427
You've just turned me into
a gun, and you're pointing me

1541
01:06:05,527 --> 01:06:06,962
at the one guy
who actually gets me.

1542
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:09,265
Well, you know what, cowboy?

1543
01:06:09,364 --> 01:06:12,367
A gun can't fire
without no bullets.

1544
01:06:12,467 --> 01:06:13,735
What the fuck are you doing?!

1545
01:06:13,835 --> 01:06:17,138
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
- Yes, yes! Yes, yes!

1546
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:20,675
Do you realize
what you just did?

1547
01:06:20,775 --> 01:06:22,095
I just saved a life,
you murderer.

1548
01:06:22,177 --> 01:06:24,679
- You piece of fu...
- Mr. Skylark.

1549
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,615
The Supreme Leader requests
your presence

1550
01:06:26,715 --> 01:06:28,275
at a restaurant
in Pyongyang for dinner.

1551
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:31,420
He will be at your door
in 30 minutes.

1552
01:06:43,565 --> 01:06:45,400
Hey, Dave.

1553
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,604
Thank you for being with me
in my time of sorrow.

1554
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:54,410
That was super-gross
and fucked-up.

1555
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:56,045
Hi.

1556
01:06:56,144 --> 01:06:58,581
Uh, Mr. Supreme Leader.

1557
01:06:58,681 --> 01:06:59,782
I'm Aaron.

1558
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,719
- Aaron?
- Hello.

1559
01:07:03,818 --> 01:07:07,623
Uh, we never got a chance to
formally meet, Mr. Great Leader.

1560
01:07:07,722 --> 01:07:10,659
I just wanted
to shake your hand.

1561
01:07:10,759 --> 01:07:14,663
Well, any friend of Dave
is a friend of mine.

1562
01:07:19,601 --> 01:07:21,737
Uh-huh.

1563
01:07:27,608 --> 01:07:29,511
No!

1564
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,280
- Don't shake that hand.
- Why not?

1565
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,548
Yeah, why not?!

1566
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:34,216
Because Aaron's a Jew.

1567
01:07:34,315 --> 01:07:37,118
- Oh, gross.
- Let's go, Supreme Leader.

1568
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,621
Okay. It was nice
meeting you.

1569
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,755
Don't you know Jews
are bad luck?

1570
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:43,292
Fuck you, fuck you!

1571
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:44,791
Friends don't kill
friends' friends.

1572
01:07:47,862 --> 01:07:50,165
Okay. Okay.

1573
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,568
Oh, fuck.

1574
01:07:58,472 --> 01:08:00,409
Mr. Rapoport, we need to review
some new data

1575
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:02,677
the Leader wants included
in tomorrow's interview.

1576
01:08:02,777 --> 01:08:05,080
Now's not really the best time.

1577
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:07,383
It will only take a moment.

1578
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:09,785
Yeah, okay.

1579
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:11,487
- Great.
- Thank you.

1580
01:08:11,586 --> 01:08:13,655
Would you like
to share a drink?

1581
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:18,094
Raise your glasses.

1582
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:19,862
Koh and Yu!

1583
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:24,600
Koh and Yu possessed the finest
trait men can have:

1584
01:08:24,699 --> 01:08:26,801
Loyalty.

1585
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:28,436
I know how you feel.
My dog Digby died

1586
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:31,407
when I was a kid, and I'm still
fucked up about it.

1587
01:08:34,542 --> 01:08:37,746
Loyalty is what
made my father

1588
01:08:37,845 --> 01:08:39,814
and grandfather
so successful.

1589
01:08:39,914 --> 01:08:42,451
That's right. Listen up.
Hey, listen up. You.

1590
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,420
Without loyalty,

1591
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,856
a country is a lawless jungle.

1592
01:08:49,858 --> 01:08:52,328
Welcome to the jungle, baby.
Welcome to the jungle.

1593
01:08:52,427 --> 01:08:54,896
On your
sh-n-n-n-n-n-n knees.

1594
01:08:54,997 --> 01:09:00,302
How else can I prevail
against so many enemies?

1595
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:02,203
Defectors.

1596
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,140
South Korean capitalists.

1597
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:06,474
The people in this room...

1598
01:09:06,574 --> 01:09:09,478
who don't think I can fill
my father's shoes!

1599
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:12,848
These bastards
deserve no humanity!

1600
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:17,920
To those who seek
to undermine me,

1601
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:20,189
at home and abroad,

1602
01:09:20,288 --> 01:09:23,224
I cannot respond
with anything less

1603
01:09:23,324 --> 01:09:26,862
than the totality
of my strength!

1604
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:30,633
If a billion people across the
Earth and in my own country

1605
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,735
must be burned to prove it

1606
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:36,337
then my worthiness as a Kim

1607
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:38,806
will be demonstrated!

1608
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:51,186
Um...

1609
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:54,289
Hey, Kim, I gotta go outside.

1610
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,192
Is that okay?
I'm just feelin'...

1611
01:09:56,292 --> 01:10:00,196
Too much, uh,
s-s-soju, whatever.

1612
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:02,798
Okay.

1613
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:04,533
I'll be back.

1614
01:10:04,632 --> 01:10:07,970
So how'd you wind up
as one of the heads

1615
01:10:08,069 --> 01:10:09,837
of a, uh, dictatorship?

1616
01:10:09,938 --> 01:10:11,507
Ah.

1617
01:10:11,606 --> 01:10:13,509
One day, party officials
came to my classroom

1618
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:15,411
in search of a young woman

1619
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:17,780
to serve on the Kim
family personal staff.

1620
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,583
They selected me.

1621
01:10:20,682 --> 01:10:22,318
Over the years,

1622
01:10:22,417 --> 01:10:24,385
I grew close
with Kim Jong-un.

1623
01:10:24,485 --> 01:10:27,789
When he rose to power,
he took me with him.

1624
01:10:29,457 --> 01:10:31,794
And here I am.

1625
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:34,563
Kinda have a guy like that
in my life, too.

1626
01:10:34,662 --> 01:10:37,665
You've been with Dave
a long time.

1627
01:10:37,765 --> 01:10:39,467
He's a hard guy to leave.

1628
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:41,488
You just like the money
and can't say no to Dave.

1629
01:10:41,502 --> 01:10:43,538
No...

1630
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:45,807
Yes! I know you.

1631
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,843
You're fuckin' awesome.

1632
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:50,546
- No, I don't understand you.
- And it's a little bit weird.

1633
01:10:50,645 --> 01:10:52,847
I mean, do you have a boyfriend
in this country?

1634
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:56,352
Is that too forward
of me to ask?

1635
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:59,454
What are you lookin' at?

1636
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:02,658
- I should leave.
- Why?

1637
01:11:02,757 --> 01:11:05,961
I'm concerned my feelings
of attraction for you

1638
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,264
will cause me to make mistakes.

1639
01:11:08,363 --> 01:11:10,331
Your feelings
of attraction for me?

1640
01:11:10,431 --> 01:11:12,867
Fuck this!

1641
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:16,303
Ever since I saw you on that
mountaintop,

1642
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:17,840
this is all I've been
thinking about.

1643
01:11:17,939 --> 01:11:19,440
Me, too.

1644
01:12:39,554 --> 01:12:42,024
Fake.

1645
01:12:42,123 --> 01:12:44,492
Fake carrots.

1646
01:12:44,592 --> 01:12:45,760
Fake fruit!

1647
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:46,929
Fake!

1648
01:12:48,729 --> 01:12:50,732
Fake!

1649
01:12:50,832 --> 01:12:53,501
Fake grapefruits!

1650
01:12:53,601 --> 01:12:55,503
Fake!

1651
01:12:56,537 --> 01:12:58,539
Liar!

1652
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:02,911
You liar!

1653
01:13:09,917 --> 01:13:11,920
Why aren't I naked yet?

1654
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,123
Uh...

1655
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:17,659
- Aah!
- Yeah.

1656
01:13:17,759 --> 01:13:20,128
You're hairy, you're
so hairy like a bear!

1657
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,164
You're fucking sexy, yeah.

1658
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:24,132
Your nipples are so pink!

1659
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,233
Yes, they are.

1660
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,568
I love it!

1661
01:13:27,869 --> 01:13:29,704
Okay, no, whoa, no!

1662
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:31,573
- No hands.
- No hands?

1663
01:13:31,672 --> 01:13:32,707
I'm not into handsy shit.

1664
01:13:32,807 --> 01:13:33,807
That's how I like it.

1665
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:34,876
Well...

1666
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:37,980
Just take it off.

1667
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:39,814
Okay.

1668
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:41,984
You said no hands!

1669
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:43,152
You fucking hit me
with your hand!

1670
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:44,953
How do I get it off?

1671
01:13:45,052 --> 01:13:48,090
Use your big, fat
American teeth.

1672
01:13:48,189 --> 01:13:50,024
Okay, I will!

1673
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:51,560
This is awesome.

1674
01:13:57,298 --> 01:13:59,201
Oh, this is hard.

1675
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:05,072
Shit...

1676
01:14:06,573 --> 01:14:08,576
Oh, shit, what's wrong?

1677
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:13,882
The numbers I gave you
on potato output...

1678
01:14:13,981 --> 01:14:16,018
are exaggerated.

1679
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:17,653
That's okay with me.
I don't really care about that.

1680
01:14:17,752 --> 01:14:18,832
If you want,
you can give me

1681
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:20,588
the real numbers,
and we can get back

1682
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:23,492
- to what we were doing.
- No, it's not just the numbers.

1683
01:14:23,591 --> 01:14:25,493
I am a terrible person.

1684
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:26,595
No, you're not.
You're the best person.

1685
01:14:26,694 --> 01:14:28,054
You were about
to have sex with me.

1686
01:14:28,095 --> 01:14:29,815
That's like the best thing
someone could do.

1687
01:14:29,864 --> 01:14:33,601
I'm the propagandist of a
totalitarian dictatorship.

1688
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:35,604
That's an area
you could improve,

1689
01:14:35,703 --> 01:14:38,139
but, you know, you don't have
to dwell on it or anything.

1690
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:42,176
He's as cruel as his father
and grandfather before him.

1691
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:43,846
You knew this
this whole time.

1692
01:14:43,945 --> 01:14:45,948
Why is this just
bothering you now?

1693
01:14:46,047 --> 01:14:47,949
It's been bothering
me for a long time,

1694
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:50,918
and I'm not the only one,

1695
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:54,923
but too many people
see him as a god.

1696
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:57,826
How do you prove to
24 million people

1697
01:14:57,926 --> 01:15:01,630
that their god is a
murderer and a liar?

1698
01:15:01,729 --> 01:15:03,729
Aaron, I need to talk.

1699
01:15:03,731 --> 01:15:05,033
Fuck, it's Dave... shit.

1700
01:15:06,268 --> 01:15:07,869
You, you hide in there,
I'll be back.

1701
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:10,072
- I'll go deal with him.
- Okay, go, go, go...

1702
01:15:10,171 --> 01:15:11,772
Oh, shit.

1703
01:15:11,872 --> 01:15:14,576
- Aaron, are you here?
- Yeah, one sec, uh, one sec.

1704
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:17,513
- One sec... don't come in,
don't come in! -I need to talk.

1705
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:19,181
Hey, how's it going, dude?

1706
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,815
- Not good.
- Uh, maybe now's

1707
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:22,117
not a good time, maybe
we should take a walk.

1708
01:15:22,216 --> 01:15:24,652
No, no, no, no,
I can't walk this off.

1709
01:15:24,752 --> 01:15:25,820
I cannot walk this off.

1710
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:27,122
I need to...

1711
01:15:28,689 --> 01:15:29,857
I'm so fucking pissed.

1712
01:15:29,957 --> 01:15:31,117
I just want to hit something!

1713
01:15:31,158 --> 01:15:32,158
No, no!

1714
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:33,295
No, don't punch anything!

1715
01:15:35,829 --> 01:15:36,832
Breathe.

1716
01:15:36,931 --> 01:15:38,733
Just breathe, maybe pace it out.

1717
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:40,668
Fuck, man.

1718
01:15:40,769 --> 01:15:42,003
Kim.

1719
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:43,838
- Wha-What about him?
- He's going crazy.

1720
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:45,207
He said he's going
to blow up the world

1721
01:15:45,306 --> 01:15:46,974
just to show that he's the shit.

1722
01:15:47,074 --> 01:15:48,710
And at first, I thought,

1723
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:50,946
"All right, maybe he's
just talking, you know,

1724
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:53,682
maybe he doesn't mean it."

1725
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:56,851
Then I saw this fake
fucking grapefruit.

1726
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:57,985
What?

1727
01:15:58,953 --> 01:16:00,689
All the food
in that grocery store is fake!

1728
01:16:00,788 --> 01:16:02,090
He fucking lied to me.

1729
01:16:02,189 --> 01:16:04,826
Maybe that, maybe that
fat kid isn't fat.

1730
01:16:04,926 --> 01:16:08,830
I mean, oh, what about
the concentration camps?

1731
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:09,965
And the famine...
maybe that's real.

1732
01:16:10,064 --> 01:16:12,033
God!

1733
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:14,735
It is... I've been telling you
that for weeks now.

1734
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:15,971
He fucking honeydicked me.

1735
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:18,105
He honeydicked
the shit out of me.

1736
01:16:18,206 --> 01:16:20,242
- Sucks.
- You still got that poison?

1737
01:16:23,344 --> 01:16:25,846
You can't speak?
What the fuck?

1738
01:16:25,947 --> 01:16:27,748
I want to know
if you have the fucking poison

1739
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:30,252
- so we can kill
that motherfucker. -What?!

1740
01:16:30,351 --> 01:16:31,920
Whoa, ho, spy!
What the hell?!

1741
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,780
- She's on our side!
- Fuck's going on here?!

1742
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:35,257
- You can trust me, I'm okay.
- You can trust her, man!

1743
01:16:35,356 --> 01:16:37,759
Trust her?! Are you joking?!
We got to kill her.

1744
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:39,895
- Oh, my God, what are you doing?
- Dude, I was in bed with her!

1745
01:16:39,994 --> 01:16:41,128
- What?!
- We're hooking up.

1746
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:42,631
- That's why she's here.
- What?!

1747
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:44,065
Let him go; everything is fine.

1748
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:45,266
Now we got to kill
the girl that you like.

1749
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:46,802
This is
the worst moment ever!

1750
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:48,369
We're not killing her!

1751
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:51,340
- She's loyal to Kim.
- No!

1752
01:16:51,439 --> 01:16:54,609
Dude, she was just telling me
she's with us.

1753
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:55,743
I hate Kim.

1754
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:57,813
He is a terrible leader.

1755
01:16:57,912 --> 01:16:59,080
- See?
- Okay.

1756
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:00,815
She can help us kill him.

1757
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:02,684
What?
No, no, no killing.

1758
01:17:02,783 --> 01:17:03,783
Kim must die.

1759
01:17:03,784 --> 01:17:05,186
That's the American way.

1760
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:08,190
How many times can the U.S. make
the same mistake?

1761
01:17:08,289 --> 01:17:09,824
As many times as it takes.

1762
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:11,393
Killing Kim won't change
anything.

1763
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:12,761
You said it yourself.

1764
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:14,395
We got to do
something, right?

1765
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:15,931
He will be replaced.

1766
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:17,164
He has brothers,
he has other generals.

1767
01:17:17,265 --> 01:17:18,367
The people need

1768
01:17:18,466 --> 01:17:21,168
to be shown
that he is not a god,

1769
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:22,771
that he is a man.

1770
01:17:22,871 --> 01:17:24,773
Then they will be
ready for change.

1771
01:17:24,872 --> 01:17:26,942
Yeah, how?

1772
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:29,177
Interviewing him.

1773
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:32,047
Everyone in North Korea
will be watching.

1774
01:17:32,146 --> 01:17:33,948
No... the interview's scripted.

1775
01:17:34,048 --> 01:17:37,252
His people are never going
to let me ask real questions.

1776
01:17:37,351 --> 01:17:39,654
Dave, I am his people.

1777
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:40,795
She controls
the broadcast.

1778
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:43,025
I can't do political interviews.

1779
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:44,926
I do entertainment
interviews.

1780
01:17:45,025 --> 01:17:47,429
Dude, you can
fucking do this.

1781
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:49,529
- Yeah? -Yeah, you don't
interview with your brain.

1782
01:17:49,530 --> 01:17:51,065
You interview
with your heart.

1783
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:53,435
- True.
- Your emotion, Dave.

1784
01:17:53,534 --> 01:17:56,438
You get Kim Jong-un
to fucking cry like a baby

1785
01:17:56,537 --> 01:17:59,206
in front of all of North Korea?

1786
01:17:59,306 --> 01:18:00,942
They'll know he's not a god.

1787
01:18:01,042 --> 01:18:04,980
- I think I can do this.
- You can do it.

1788
01:18:05,079 --> 01:18:08,350
I'm Dave Skylark
and I can interview anyone.

1789
01:18:08,449 --> 01:18:09,818
Yeah, you can.

1790
01:18:09,917 --> 01:18:12,286
Let's take
this motherfucker down!

1791
01:18:26,167 --> 01:18:28,236
- Oh, God, oh, God!
- Oh, ah!

1792
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:30,176
- You got a lot
of pent-up energy! -

1793
01:18:30,271 --> 01:18:31,271
Oh, God!

1794
01:18:33,474 --> 01:18:35,711
Okay, everything's ready.

1795
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:36,844
Uh, you ready to rock?

1796
01:18:36,944 --> 01:18:37,978
Y-You memorize all those facts?

1797
01:18:38,078 --> 01:18:39,078
I'm ready, baby.

1798
01:18:39,079 --> 01:18:40,148
Great.

1799
01:18:40,247 --> 01:18:41,767
How many people
in concentration camps?

1800
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:42,850
200,000.

1801
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:43,851
How many people malnourished?

1802
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:45,052
16 million.

1803
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:47,055
They spent $800 million
on nukes last year

1804
01:18:47,154 --> 01:18:50,425
and got $200 million
in food aid from the UN.

1805
01:18:50,524 --> 01:18:52,793
And I got more where
that came from, baby.

1806
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:55,262
Really good... you're
going to nail this shit.

1807
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:57,132
- I just wish we had a fucking
escape plan. -Why don't we go

1808
01:18:57,231 --> 01:18:59,351
- to Japan? -Well, 'cause it's
across the Sea of Japan.

1809
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:01,036
- Why don't we swim?
- Can't swim that.

1810
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:02,904
- Oh, I'm a good swimmer.
- It's really, really far.

1811
01:19:03,003 --> 01:19:04,405
- People have done it.
- Nope.

1812
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:06,306
- Yep, Michael Phelps did it.
- That's not true.

1813
01:19:06,307 --> 01:19:07,347
Okay. -Okay.

1814
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:09,289
Skylark, two-minute warning.

1815
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:10,779
Just keep me on the air
as long as you can.

1816
01:19:10,878 --> 01:19:11,912
I will, man.

1817
01:19:12,012 --> 01:19:13,782
Maybe we won't get
out of here.

1818
01:19:13,881 --> 01:19:15,216
No, we might die.

1819
01:19:15,317 --> 01:19:17,786
I've had a great life.

1820
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:19,154
I had the best best friend.

1821
01:19:19,253 --> 01:19:21,890
Fucked more women
than Ellen DeGeneres.

1822
01:19:21,989 --> 01:19:23,425
And now it's time

1823
01:19:23,524 --> 01:19:25,760
for the North Korean people
to get their dicks wet.

1824
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:29,765
This is a perfect ending
for the tell-all.

1825
01:19:31,231 --> 01:19:35,170
As the two best friends
stared each other in the eyes,

1826
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:38,173
they knew
that this might be

1827
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:40,342
the end
of the long road,

1828
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:42,444
but they also knew

1829
01:19:42,543 --> 01:19:45,247
how much they meant to
each other, and even though

1830
01:19:45,346 --> 01:19:48,916
neither one could say it
out loud,

1831
01:19:49,016 --> 01:19:51,485
they were both thinking...

1832
01:19:51,586 --> 01:19:54,122
I love you.

1833
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:58,059
Okay, man, you got this.

1834
01:19:58,158 --> 01:19:59,158
Okay.

1835
01:20:02,395 --> 01:20:04,398
Showtime.

1836
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:04,059
Dave.

1837
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:05,393
Kim.

1838
01:21:07,994 --> 01:21:09,434
Are you ready to share
with the world

1839
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:11,399
that gorgeous smile of yours?

1840
01:21:11,498 --> 01:21:14,469
Tonight, I think it's
your smile they want to see.

1841
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:17,405
I have something for you.

1842
01:21:17,505 --> 01:21:19,140
What?!

1843
01:21:21,676 --> 01:21:22,878
What's this?

1844
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:24,212
Open.

1845
01:21:30,583 --> 01:21:32,653
Aw... aw!

1846
01:21:32,753 --> 01:21:34,288
For me?

1847
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:36,291
For you.

1848
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:39,094
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh...!

1849
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:41,897
Oh, he's just like Digby.

1850
01:21:41,997 --> 01:21:43,097
Just like Digby.

1851
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:44,432
I think I'm gonna die.

1852
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:46,368
- Oh, my God...
- Don't die, please.

1853
01:21:46,467 --> 01:21:48,435
Not till after the interview.

1854
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:51,105
This dog is killing me
with cuteness.

1855
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:53,108
- He's crazy cute.
- Can I keep it?

1856
01:21:53,207 --> 01:21:55,576
Take him home,
forever and ever.

1857
01:21:55,676 --> 01:21:57,912
Why?

1858
01:21:58,012 --> 01:22:02,617
I live a lonely life, Dave...

1859
01:22:02,716 --> 01:22:05,252
and it warms my heart to know

1860
01:22:05,353 --> 01:22:07,188
that there is someone
in this world

1861
01:22:07,287 --> 01:22:10,391
with whom I can truly be myself.

1862
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:13,395
Whatever they say about you...

1863
01:22:15,128 --> 01:22:16,530
...they're wrong.

1864
01:22:18,466 --> 01:22:21,202
I'm just me and I do my best.

1865
01:22:21,301 --> 01:22:22,403
You're my brother.

1866
01:22:24,171 --> 01:22:25,506
You're my brother.

1867
01:22:27,507 --> 01:22:29,344
Let's get this
out of the way, okay?

1868
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,112
- Okay.
- Okay.

1869
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:33,648
And what are
we gonna name you, huh?

1870
01:22:33,747 --> 01:22:35,549
You need a name?
Yes, you do.

1871
01:22:41,588 --> 01:22:43,725
Look, look.
He looks just like Digby.

1872
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:47,362
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1873
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:49,631
We see you
in a minute. Bye-bye.

1874
01:22:51,431 --> 01:22:52,533
- Okay...
- Okay.

1875
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,368
- Shall we begin?
- Are you ready?

1876
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:55,670
Shut the fuck up.

1877
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:57,130
Guys, it's starting!
It's starting.

1878
01:22:58,472 --> 01:23:01,342
And we're on in five...

1879
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:03,311
four, three...

1880
01:23:06,346 --> 01:23:08,015
Good evening.

1881
01:23:08,115 --> 01:23:09,684
And good morning to our viewers
around the world.

1882
01:23:09,783 --> 01:23:11,518
I'm Dave Skylark.

1883
01:23:11,618 --> 01:23:15,523
Thank you for joining me for
this historic moment in history.

1884
01:23:15,622 --> 01:23:17,291
I'm with President Kim Jong-un

1885
01:23:17,391 --> 01:23:20,260
of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea.

1886
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:22,197
We are broadcasting

1887
01:23:22,296 --> 01:23:24,365
from a station
outside of Pyongyang

1888
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:26,201
for this very special
edition of:

1889
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:28,069
"Skylark Tonight."

1890
01:23:29,503 --> 01:23:31,605
Thank you for joining me,

1891
01:23:31,706 --> 01:23:33,307
President Kim Jong-un.

1892
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:35,076
It is my pleasure, Dave.

1893
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:37,679
You know, there is so much
misunderstanding

1894
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:39,414
about North Korea

1895
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:41,382
and, uh, me personally.

1896
01:23:41,483 --> 01:23:43,418
- Mm-hmm.
- And I can't think of a man

1897
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:45,686
with greater intelligence
than you.

1898
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:47,222
I am grateful

1899
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:49,757
for this opportunity
for my government

1900
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:52,159
and for the international
community

1901
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:55,797
to forge a better relationship.

1902
01:23:55,896 --> 01:23:57,564
So you want to set
the record straight.

1903
01:23:57,664 --> 01:23:59,033
Indeed, Dave.

1904
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:00,568
Camera three.

1905
01:24:00,667 --> 01:24:02,103
Tensions between your nation

1906
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:05,340
and South Korea are
at an all-time high.

1907
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:08,509
It's fair to say that you're on
the brink of armed conflict.

1908
01:24:08,609 --> 01:24:11,179
So, what I want to know is:

1909
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:13,715
In these times of great stress,

1910
01:24:13,814 --> 01:24:15,582
do you do karaoke?

1911
01:24:15,682 --> 01:24:17,351
Yes, I do, Dave.

1912
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:21,056
I believe that it is important
for those in power

1913
01:24:21,155 --> 01:24:23,524
to remain in touch
with the beauty in life.

1914
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:26,661
You are also a very accomplished
painter, aren't you?

1915
01:24:26,761 --> 01:24:28,329
Well, how can I not be?

1916
01:24:28,429 --> 01:24:29,829
He's reading
the scripted questions.

1917
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:31,666
He lulls them
and then he gets them.

1918
01:24:31,765 --> 01:24:33,268
It's his technique.

1919
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:34,669
The beauty guides you.

1920
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:36,237
It guides my hand.

1921
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:38,773
This is fuckin' bullshit.

1922
01:24:38,872 --> 01:24:40,442
Let's take it to a serious tip.

1923
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:42,277
Supreme Leader Kim,
when...

1924
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:44,145
the United States,

1925
01:24:44,244 --> 01:24:47,282
which has an enormous stockpile
of nuclear weapons,

1926
01:24:47,381 --> 01:24:52,453
insists that countries
like yours have none,

1927
01:24:52,554 --> 01:24:55,489
does that feel
hypocritical to you?

1928
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,859
Many Americans do not realize

1929
01:24:57,958 --> 01:25:00,161
that the war in North Korea

1930
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:02,864
was entirely the fault
of the United States.

1931
01:25:02,963 --> 01:25:05,699
Damn! Kim's callin' us out!

1932
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,720
- You really are still hopeful?
- No, no, I'm not

1933
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:10,171
hopeful at all.
He's totally bailed on the plan.

1934
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:12,306
America, what you done
to these Koreans?

1935
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:14,409
This is a little embarrassing.

1936
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:17,244
So when you think of all that
your country has been through...

1937
01:25:17,345 --> 01:25:20,148
The wars, the floods...

1938
01:25:20,247 --> 01:25:22,683
do you think that your people
should be rewarded

1939
01:25:22,783 --> 01:25:25,786
for their resilience
and strength?

1940
01:25:25,886 --> 01:25:28,456
Of course, Dave.

1941
01:25:31,725 --> 01:25:33,561
Then why don't you feed them?

1942
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:39,734
Hmm.. -Mm...

1943
01:25:41,435 --> 01:25:45,206
Uh... I...

1944
01:25:45,305 --> 01:25:47,207
Camera two.

1945
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:50,912
I... beg your pardon?

1946
01:25:51,011 --> 01:25:53,280
Why don't you feed your people?

1947
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:54,481
They are hungry.

1948
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:56,551
Specifically,
two-thirds of them?

1949
01:25:56,650 --> 01:25:58,920
Isn't that a little
embarrassing, since you're

1950
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:01,289
the one they view
as a provider and a god?

1951
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:04,359
And you spend $800 million
on nukes every year?

1952
01:26:04,458 --> 01:26:05,926
And you have 16 million people

1953
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:07,529
who are starving?

1954
01:26:13,533 --> 01:26:16,436
Are you sure you don't, uh...

1955
01:26:16,537 --> 01:26:19,173
mean to ask me
about potato yields?

1956
01:26:19,274 --> 01:26:20,508
No, I want to know

1957
01:26:20,608 --> 01:26:22,177
about that other thing
I just asked.

1958
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:23,478
Okay, uh, well, uh...

1959
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:26,314
Dave, as you have seen
for yourself

1960
01:26:26,413 --> 01:26:29,184
we have a great bounty of food
in North Korea.

1961
01:26:29,283 --> 01:26:31,219
What I saw for myself

1962
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:34,589
was a fake grocery store

1963
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,891
with a fake fat kid planted
right in front of it.

1964
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,796
Okay, uh, this is, uh...

1965
01:26:42,896 --> 01:26:44,731
an offensive
line of questioning.

1966
01:26:44,832 --> 01:26:47,268
I don't think it's offensive.
I think it's super important.

1967
01:26:47,368 --> 01:26:48,503
Obviously, if you don't want
to answer these questions,

1968
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:49,671
you can just get up
and walk away.

1969
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:51,738
I can't keep you
from retreating.

1970
01:26:51,838 --> 01:26:53,507
- He's gonna go for the button.
- He's not. He's sitting there.

1971
01:26:53,608 --> 01:26:55,476
- He's not moving.
- He's going for the button.

1972
01:26:55,576 --> 01:26:57,612
He's going for the button,
he's going for the button...

1973
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:58,613
He's not. Oh, shit.
He's making a move!

1974
01:26:58,712 --> 01:27:00,881
Don't move, homie!

1975
01:27:00,981 --> 01:27:02,781
Get your hand away from there!
Get over there!

1976
01:27:02,783 --> 01:27:03,783
Over there!

1977
01:27:03,784 --> 01:27:04,885
Get over there!

1978
01:27:06,619 --> 01:27:07,654
I will cap you!

1979
01:27:07,755 --> 01:27:08,957
I'm exploding with energy.

1980
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,591
I can't believe
this is happening.

1981
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:12,894
I feel so alive right now.
This is so real.

1982
01:27:12,993 --> 01:27:15,429
He's got him. Nice!

1983
01:27:15,529 --> 01:27:16,849
- Dave! Dave...
- I know you, Kim.

1984
01:27:24,805 --> 01:27:26,307
Dave...

1985
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:28,443
perhaps the question
you should ask is:

1986
01:27:28,542 --> 01:27:32,246
How have I managed to keep
my country so well-nourished

1987
01:27:32,346 --> 01:27:35,315
despite the harsh and unjust
economic sanctions

1988
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:39,386
imposed on North Korea
by the United States?

1989
01:27:39,487 --> 01:27:41,956
Sanctions? Uh...

1990
01:27:42,055 --> 01:27:43,790
Don't you know
that the United States

1991
01:27:43,890 --> 01:27:46,960
has more incarcerated people
per capita than North Korea?

1992
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:48,929
- No. But...
- So, perhaps, now,

1993
01:27:49,029 --> 01:27:50,731
you would like to return

1994
01:27:50,832 --> 01:27:54,335
to the civil discussion
we had originally agreed upon.

1995
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:56,471
Uh...

1996
01:27:56,570 --> 01:27:58,405
No!

1997
01:28:02,676 --> 01:28:04,612
Oh, shit! Go to camera one!

1998
01:28:08,881 --> 01:28:10,851
Camera three! Camera three!

1999
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:17,892
Do not move, homie!

2000
01:28:26,466 --> 01:28:28,869
Give me something!
Give me fucking something!

2001
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:30,771
Okay...

2002
01:28:30,872 --> 01:28:32,707
Why?!

2003
01:28:32,806 --> 01:28:34,908
Fuck! Shit, that hurts!

2004
01:28:35,009 --> 01:28:37,511
We don't have
concentration camps, Dave.

2005
01:28:37,612 --> 01:28:39,846
Have you seen
one person mistreated

2006
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:41,983
since your arrival here?

2007
01:28:45,618 --> 01:28:47,487
Oh, shit!
Someone's coming.

2008
01:28:47,587 --> 01:28:48,755
Someone's coming.

2009
01:29:02,636 --> 01:29:04,372
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

2010
01:29:04,471 --> 01:29:07,375
Dave, unless you can show me
a person, a photo

2011
01:29:07,475 --> 01:29:08,609
of widespread hunger...

2012
01:29:15,481 --> 01:29:16,481
Aaron!

2013
01:29:29,596 --> 01:29:31,498
Do not fuck with my angles!

2014
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:46,047
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

2015
01:29:47,146 --> 01:29:48,582
You're fucking up
the angles!

2016
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:51,386
Sit still!

2017
01:29:51,485 --> 01:29:53,520
Go wide, camera two!

2018
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:55,523
Slow push!

2019
01:30:08,469 --> 01:30:10,538
Thank you!

2020
01:30:10,637 --> 01:30:12,606
Face it, Dave, you have failed.

2021
01:30:12,707 --> 01:30:16,110
You've made wild allegations
but you have proven nothing.

2022
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:17,811
You made this long journey

2023
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:20,081
just to show the world that they
were right about you.

2024
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:24,117
You are incapable of
conducting a real interview.

2025
01:30:24,217 --> 01:30:26,753
You're a joke!

2026
01:30:29,722 --> 01:30:31,692
Maybe you're right.

2027
01:30:31,792 --> 01:30:34,829
Yeah, it sucks.

2028
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:37,030
Because I need
people's approval.

2029
01:30:39,265 --> 01:30:40,734
Desperately.

2030
01:30:40,835 --> 01:30:42,103
Because I could never get it

2031
01:30:42,203 --> 01:30:44,572
from my father when I was a kid.

2032
01:30:51,912 --> 01:30:54,916
But I see a lot of
the same thing in you, Kim.

2033
01:30:56,115 --> 01:30:57,717
Your father...

2034
01:30:57,818 --> 01:31:02,590
deprived you of
life's simplest pleasures.

2035
01:31:03,756 --> 01:31:06,193
He told you
that margaritas are gay.

2036
01:31:06,293 --> 01:31:10,163
I have no comment on margaritas.

2037
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:11,865
Then why don't you drink them?

2038
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:14,635
I... don't like brain freeze.

2039
01:31:15,836 --> 01:31:17,605
Fuck you, Dave.

2040
01:31:17,704 --> 01:31:20,675
You fucking asshole.

2041
01:31:20,774 --> 01:31:22,844

01:33:17,257 --> 01:33:19,159
Kim Jong-un has just pooed

2084
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:20,293
in his pants.

2085
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:28,069
Let's get the fuck out of here.

2086
01:33:28,168 --> 01:33:30,671
Yeah, let's go.

2087
01:34:10,744 --> 01:34:12,345
Damn, girl.

2088
01:34:12,445 --> 01:34:14,047
You a bad-ass.

2089
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:16,083
I thought
you were my friend, Dave.

2090
01:34:16,182 --> 01:34:19,119
I thought you were
my friend, Kim.

2091
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:21,789
I thought everyone lied
about you.

2092
01:34:21,889 --> 01:34:23,990
And then I saw
that fake grapefruit

2093
01:34:24,091 --> 01:34:26,060
in that fake grocery store,

2094
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:29,130
and I realized that you were
a fake friend.

2095
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:32,932
And then you said
you were gonna blow everybody up

2096
01:34:33,033 --> 01:34:35,202
just to show what
a big guy you are?

2097
01:34:35,301 --> 01:34:36,703
No friend would blow up
another friend's country.

2098
01:34:36,804 --> 01:34:39,239
You're just a flawed man

2099
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:41,409
with a big old butthole.

2100
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:43,743
And you pee and poo
like the rest of us.

2101
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:56,223
Well, tell me this, Dave.

2102
01:34:58,192 --> 01:34:59,827
Will you be so cocky

2103
01:34:59,926 --> 01:35:02,295
when I slay you in front
of the whole world,

2104
01:35:02,395 --> 01:35:04,764
you Yankee motherfucker?

2105
01:35:04,864 --> 01:35:06,032
If you shoot me,

2106
01:35:06,132 --> 01:35:09,269
you'll just be proving me right.

2107
01:35:09,369 --> 01:35:10,738
You're just a sad little man.

2108
01:35:15,341 --> 01:35:17,744
Dave! Dave! No!

2109
01:35:22,283 --> 01:35:23,884
This is Dave Skylark

2110
01:35:23,984 --> 01:35:25,419
signing off.

2111
01:35:31,925 --> 01:35:33,927
Good-bye, Dave.

2112
01:35:43,036 --> 01:35:44,739
Oh, man.

2113
01:35:51,377 --> 01:35:53,079
Bulletproof vest.

2114
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:54,882
Genius!

2115
01:35:56,449 --> 01:35:57,952
He's alive, everybody!

2116
01:35:58,051 --> 01:35:59,052
Oh, fuck!

2117
01:35:59,153 --> 01:36:00,887
Got a bulletproof vest on!

2118
01:36:00,988 --> 01:36:03,324
I don't know how he got it,
but he's got it on!

2119
01:36:03,423 --> 01:36:05,792
Thank you for watching
my interview with Kim Jong-un.

2120
01:36:05,893 --> 01:36:07,293
This is Dave Skylark

2121
01:36:07,394 --> 01:36:09,363
signing off.

2122
01:36:09,462 --> 01:36:11,164
No!

2123
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:13,467
- Aaron!
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

2124
01:36:13,567 --> 01:36:14,902
Wait!

2125
01:36:15,002 --> 01:36:16,103
The puppy.

2126
01:36:16,203 --> 01:36:18,172
Hey, what happened to your hand?

2127
01:36:18,271 --> 01:36:19,439
Someone bit
my fucking fingers off.

2128
01:36:19,539 --> 01:36:20,841
That's just like Frodo!

2129
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:23,109
Oh, shit!

2130
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:24,478
Don't shoot! I have a puppy!

2131
01:36:40,027 --> 01:36:41,127
Go!

2132
01:36:45,231 --> 01:36:46,233
Oh, no! No!

2133
01:36:46,332 --> 01:36:47,412
- What is that?!
- Oh, oh, no!

2134
01:36:47,467 --> 01:36:48,467
Oh, shit!

2135
01:36:48,502 --> 01:36:50,137
Oh, God!

2136
01:36:50,237 --> 01:36:51,372
Oh, no!

2137
01:36:51,471 --> 01:36:53,340
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit! there's more!

2138
01:36:55,475 --> 01:36:56,543
You're a hero!

2139
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:58,813
Thank you, sir!

2140
01:37:52,332 --> 01:37:54,268
That's the only way out.

2141
01:37:54,368 --> 01:37:55,269
Hey...

2142
01:37:55,368 --> 01:37:57,304
I have an idea.

2143
01:37:57,404 --> 01:37:58,439
Follow me.

2144
01:38:12,618 --> 01:38:15,488
Is this Katy fucking Perry?!

2145
01:38:15,588 --> 01:38:17,490
Just leave it on!
It's helping me concentrate.

2146
01:38:31,104 --> 01:38:33,073
Oh, shit,
are those fucking nukes?

2147
01:38:33,172 --> 01:38:34,240
Let me check!

2148
01:38:37,310 --> 01:38:38,510
Oh, we really fucked up!

2149
01:38:38,578 --> 01:38:40,980
He's arming
his fucking nukes!

2150
01:38:46,552 --> 01:38:47,587
Aah! Fuck!

2151
01:38:58,530 --> 01:39:00,533
Skylark!

2152
01:39:05,404 --> 01:39:07,974
Kim!

2153
01:39:08,074 --> 01:39:09,676
Fuck you!

2154
01:39:11,277 --> 01:39:12,413
Fire!

2155
01:39:25,658 --> 01:39:27,427
I've been grazed!

2156
01:39:27,528 --> 01:39:29,262
- How's the puppy?
- Puppy is okay!

2157
01:39:29,363 --> 01:39:31,131
You protect that puppy
with your life.

2158
01:39:42,108 --> 01:39:43,143
We got to do something!

2159
01:39:43,243 --> 01:39:44,545
He's gonna fucking kill us!

2160
01:39:44,645 --> 01:39:45,546
We're in a tank!

2161
01:39:45,645 --> 01:39:46,646
Shoot him back.

2162
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:51,552
It's loaded!

2163
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:54,587
Let's barbeque
this motherfucker.

2164
01:40:02,229 --> 01:40:03,229
On three.

2165
01:40:04,698 --> 01:40:06,166
Balls to the wall,
motherfuckers!

2166
01:40:07,567 --> 01:40:09,168
Boom, boom...

2167
01:40:10,569 --> 01:40:11,704
Boom!

2168
01:41:37,689 --> 01:41:39,092
Yes!

2169
01:41:39,193 --> 01:41:41,595
Yes! Yes!

2170
01:41:41,694 --> 01:41:43,162
Yes!

2171
01:41:43,262 --> 01:41:45,832
- Okay.
- Okay.

2172
01:41:45,932 --> 01:41:48,435
That way.

2173
01:41:48,534 --> 01:41:50,369
It's an old mining tunnel.

2174
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:51,637
- Holy shit, where does that go?
- West.

2175
01:41:51,738 --> 01:41:53,606
Away from Pyongyang.

2176
01:41:53,707 --> 01:41:55,309
Keep moving
until you reach the coast.

2177
01:41:55,408 --> 01:41:57,210
I wish you both luck.

2178
01:41:57,310 --> 01:41:58,478
You sound like you're
not coming with us.

2179
01:41:58,578 --> 01:41:59,479
- Yeah, Sook....?
- What-what are you doing?

2180
01:41:59,579 --> 01:42:01,314
I have to go to Pyongyang.

2181
01:42:01,414 --> 01:42:02,783
That's going right back
into the snake pit.

2182
01:42:02,882 --> 01:42:04,217
I can't leave North Korea.

2183
01:42:04,318 --> 01:42:06,119
I just helped plunge it
into chaos.

2184
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:07,721
- Yeah, yeah. -So did we.
I'm okay with leaving.

2185
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:09,389
I have to ensure that the power

2186
01:42:09,488 --> 01:42:10,928
does not transfer
to the wrong hands.

2187
01:42:10,990 --> 01:42:12,592
I can't deny

2188
01:42:12,693 --> 01:42:14,494
that we have a chemistry,

2189
01:42:14,595 --> 01:42:17,197
but I have to stay here
for my people.

2190
01:42:18,363 --> 01:42:19,732
Okay.

2191
01:42:19,832 --> 01:42:22,235
I'm glad to meet you.

2192
01:42:22,336 --> 01:42:23,637
Okay.

2193
01:42:23,737 --> 01:42:25,639
Kiss her.

2194
01:42:27,539 --> 01:42:29,342
Kiss her, dude.

2195
01:42:29,443 --> 01:42:30,878
Yeah, get in there.

2196
01:42:34,747 --> 01:42:36,482
Ooh...

2197
01:42:40,386 --> 01:42:43,556
I'm happy
to have met you, Aaron.

2198
01:42:43,657 --> 01:42:45,559
You, too.

2199
01:42:46,693 --> 01:42:48,162
Bye, Sook.

2200
01:42:48,261 --> 01:42:50,163
Have fun with the war.

2201
01:43:12,284 --> 01:43:14,188
- All right, it's clear.
- Okay.

2202
01:43:16,788 --> 01:43:17,858
Okay, here you go.

2203
01:43:17,957 --> 01:43:19,458
- You got him?
- All right... got him.

2204
01:43:19,559 --> 01:43:20,694
Yeah.

2205
01:43:20,793 --> 01:43:22,729
You out of that
big, old, scary hole?

2206
01:43:25,364 --> 01:43:27,300
Where are we?

2207
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:28,734
I don't know.

2208
01:43:28,835 --> 01:43:30,270
Is this China?

2209
01:43:30,369 --> 01:43:31,671
I don't know.
Looks like North Korea.

2210
01:43:31,771 --> 01:43:32,838
Yeah.

2211
01:43:32,939 --> 01:43:34,474
Man.

2212
01:43:34,573 --> 01:43:36,373
- Well, which way's the coast?
- I have no idea.

2213
01:43:36,376 --> 01:43:37,711
Does that do something?

2214
01:43:37,810 --> 01:43:39,412
Dogs always run to the sea.

2215
01:43:39,512 --> 01:43:41,681
- That's not true.
- You got to find the sea.

2216
01:43:41,782 --> 01:43:43,342
I don't think
that's gonna happen, Dave.

2217
01:43:43,417 --> 01:43:44,851
Shit.

2218
01:43:44,951 --> 01:43:46,987
- Shit! Shit! Shit!
- Protect the puppy!

2219
01:43:47,087 --> 01:43:49,556
- Protect the puppy!
- Stop! It's them.

2220
01:43:51,556 --> 01:43:52,826
Echo Romeo Five.

2221
01:43:52,926 --> 01:43:54,895
Echo Romeo Five,
we have contact

2222
01:43:54,994 --> 01:43:56,762
with Dung Beetle and Aardvark.

2223
01:43:56,863 --> 01:43:58,999
Aaron, Dave, I'm Captain Sung,

2224
01:43:59,099 --> 01:44:01,001
- SEAL Team Six.
- Holy shit.

2225
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:02,368
How'd you guys find us?

2226
01:44:02,469 --> 01:44:03,604
We tracked you using the GPS

2227
01:44:03,703 --> 01:44:04,737
- on your wristwatch.
- Oh, my God.

2228
01:44:04,837 --> 01:44:05,905
Let's get you boys home.

2229
01:44:06,006 --> 01:44:07,341
Oh, my God.

2230
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:08,507
For you.

2231
01:44:08,608 --> 01:44:09,909
Me?

2232
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:11,345
Is it the president?

2233
01:44:11,444 --> 01:44:12,746
Mr. Obama?

2234
01:44:12,845 --> 01:44:14,714
Nope, just me, Agent Lacey.

2235
01:44:14,814 --> 01:44:16,515
Agent Lacey.

2236
01:44:16,615 --> 01:44:17,884
Fancy hearing from you here.

2237
01:44:17,984 --> 01:44:20,454
I enjoyed your interview, guys.

2238
01:44:20,554 --> 01:44:23,023
Now try not to fuck up
your extraction.

2239
01:44:23,122 --> 01:44:25,024
Get home safe.

2240
01:44:25,125 --> 01:44:28,362
Guess who's going to America
where they don't eat doggies?

2241
01:44:28,462 --> 01:44:30,364
- And you get all the good stuff,
- Okay, let's just go.

2242
01:44:30,463 --> 01:44:32,744
- and it's nice. -Let's get
out... Can we please go? Okay.

2243
01:44:43,676 --> 01:44:44,811
Get them in.

2244
01:44:46,378 --> 01:44:47,747
Take the dog.

2245
01:45:11,904 --> 01:45:13,407
She honeypotted me.

2246
01:45:13,506 --> 01:45:14,974
What? What are you
talking about?

2247
01:45:15,074 --> 01:45:16,309
Sook.

2248
01:45:16,409 --> 01:45:17,677
Think about it, man.

2249
01:45:17,778 --> 01:45:20,380
I mean, she researched me,
she seduced me,

2250
01:45:20,479 --> 01:45:22,715
she commandeered my plans,
made them her own.

2251
01:45:22,815 --> 01:45:24,451
I mean, she used me.

2252
01:45:24,551 --> 01:45:27,988
I'll admit it was for, like,
a really good fucking cause,

2253
01:45:28,087 --> 01:45:29,956
but she honeypotted me.

2254
01:45:30,055 --> 01:45:31,390
Yeah.

2255
01:45:31,490 --> 01:45:32,525
Well, good riddance.

2256
01:45:32,626 --> 01:45:33,960
I hated that fucking bitch.

2257
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:35,062
Really?

2258
01:45:36,595 --> 01:45:39,598
Nah, just thought it would
make you feel better.

2259
01:45:39,698 --> 01:45:41,600
That was your one true love.

2260
01:45:41,701 --> 01:45:43,603
Now she's gone.

2261
01:45:43,703 --> 01:45:46,707
Doesn't make me

2262
01:45:46,806 --> 01:45:49,009
Well, you have us,

2263
01:45:49,109 --> 01:45:51,011
and "we wuv you."

2264
01:45:55,014 --> 01:45:57,617
"We aw wuv each other."

2265
01:46:06,225 --> 01:46:08,561
"And as
the North Korean coastline

2266
01:46:08,662 --> 01:46:10,463
"receded in the distance,

2267
01:46:10,564 --> 01:46:13,900
"we heard the crackling
of gunfire.

2268
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,738
"It was the beginning
of a revolution...

2269
01:46:17,837 --> 01:46:22,041
"a revolution
Aaron and I started.

2270
01:46:22,141 --> 01:46:25,378
"Of course, in a tale like this,

2271
01:46:25,479 --> 01:46:27,748
"you might expect to find

"honeypot

2274
01:46:32,252 --> 01:46:34,788

2275
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:43,662
"...maybe a few drones

2276
01:46:43,762 --> 01:46:46,899
or a secret CIA watch."

2277
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,402
You got Skype!

2278
01:46:48,502 --> 01:46:49,503
So good to see your face.

2279
01:46:49,603 --> 01:46:51,037
Wait, someone else
wants to say hi.

2280
01:46:52,506 --> 01:46:53,539
Guess what we named him?

2281
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:54,908
Kim Jong-un.

2282
01:46:55,007 --> 01:46:56,742
Aaron, that's a little
fucked up, no?

2283
01:46:56,842 --> 01:46:58,912
Oh, it's super fucked up,
but he's cute, though.

2284
01:46:59,011 --> 01:47:01,414
"But there was none of that.

2285
01:47:01,515 --> 01:47:02,749
"No.

2286
01:47:02,849 --> 01:47:04,918
"This was a revolution

"ignited with nothing more

01:47:07,787 --> 01:47:09,423
"than a camera

2289
01:47:09,523 --> 01:47:11,056
"and some questions.

01:47:11,157 --> 01:47:13,960
"Questions that led a man

"and shit his pants.

2294
01:47:21,067 --> 01:47:24,837
The end."

2295
01:47:24,938 --> 01:47:25,938
Thank you.
